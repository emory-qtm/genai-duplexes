abuse,TRUE,figurative,"Night hums low, a bruised refrain, 
Shadows twist in silent pain. 
Yet dawn’s pale tongue still tastes the same— 
A whisper, heavy as a chain. 

The echoes call, a mournful tune, 
A silver note the silence broke. 
They echo softly, hearts askew— 
Beneath the weight no voice spoke. 

Hope flickers, fragile, thin and bright, 
But walls press close, unyielding. 
A ghostly laugh in darkness lights 
The corners where the tears are bleeding. 

A sigh escapes the locked cage, 
A moth drawn to the flame’s allure. 
In mirrored glass, the truth engages— 
Reflected loss, yet still it sure. 

The river bends, the sky weeps blue, 
Each wave a memory, never whole. 
In echoes, I find you— 
And longing only fills the hole. 

Love’s echo breaks, then softly grows— 
A thorned rose in winter’s bone. 
Though shadows fall, I know the throes 
That shape the ache, the one I’ve known. 

The last refrain returns again— 
A note of sorrow, soft and dire. 
The night is stitched with threads of pain, 
Yet still the heart must rise, set fire. 
"
abuse,TRUE,specific,"A rusty key beneath the splintered floor, 
Locked memories that no one could restore. 
Yet in its teeth, a silent plea persists— 
Unscrews the cage where pain still exists. 

Beneath the floor, the ache was quietly kept; 
Now, it stirs the air, refusing to sleep. 
Like a blues refrain, my breath turns slow— 
Each turn of key unwinds what I don’t know. 

A ghazal whisper in the dust I sweep— 
You left your mark, but I must keep it deep. 
Yet this old lock, though scarred, still holds the gate 
To rooms where hurt still hums, unafraid. 

The weight of years, a chain I never broke, 
Still drags at heart when shadows spoke. 
But in the click, I find a trace of light— 
A moment’s freedom in the locked night. 

Now, key and wound entwined in fragile hold, 
Reflection bends the story, yet unfolds. 
A memory, bruised, yet in its shape I see— 
The moment I first locked the part of me. 
"
activities,TRUE,general,"
Activities bloom in morning’s pale light, 
Yet shadows weave where hours slip through. 
My hands chase tasks, yet time hides the sight— 
A restless hum in the air I knew. 


The clock ticks slow; I dance with the wait, 
A slow-blues refrain in each passing breath. 
My feet trace old patterns, unsure of fate— 
A jazzy ache in the rhythm of death. 


Routine’s tangle knots all I set out, 
Yet laughter sparks in the window’s frame. 
Each motion bends, bends, then breaks out— 
A ghazal sigh as I lose my name. 


The phone rings—another world to chase, 
But home beckons, soft as a remembered song. 
I plot and scribble, but the day’s trace 
Is a faded map where I’ve wandered wrong. 
 

Gathering dust, yet each act leaves a mark— 
A whisper in the silent, empty room. 
My footsteps trace the blue I can’t remark— 
A sonnet’s end in the quiet gloom. 


The night gathers, heavy as my plans, 
But dreams stir—activities in their flight. 
I find the thread that ties all our hands— 
A duet woven with day and night. 


Again, activities in the silent air, 
Each one a note in a fractured refrain. 
I sing the blues of a task not done— 
Yet hope hums, a melody through pain. 


Activities: loop I cannot unmake, 
Yet in their turn, I find where I begin— 
Not just what’s done, but the space I create 
Where meaning lingers, and I might win. 
"
activities,TRUE,figurative,"
Night’s rhythm hums, a restless tune, 
Steps echo where my thoughts have strayed— 
A wandering shadow, lost and soon, 
Drifts in the currents of the made. 
Murmurs sway, a low familiar cry, 
In mirrored halls of memory’s hall— 
I trace the lines where joy and sorrow lie, 
Each echo spins a story tall. 
Sighs bend the air with a blues refrain, 
Light flickers, restless as a mind, 
Old patterns form, then twist again— 
Hope and doubt in the same twined. 
Moonlight kneels, then rises, slow, 
Through sorrow’s dusk, I walk the road— 
Night’s echo calls what morning knows: 
We find ourselves in the paths we’ve trod."
activities,TRUE,specific,"
Bent paperclip—my morning’s first hold, 
Twists hope like a river lost in snow. 
It clasps my plans, but slips in the cold, 
A whisper of longing I can’t let go. 
 
Clasp, let go—my hand remembers 
A classroom’s laughter, metal in clutch. 
It bends under time, yet never breaks, 
A tiny blue sigh, a brittle touch. 
 

Time bends the small things, sharp as a sigh, 
Each loop a memory that won’t let go. 
The clip’s cold curve—where my day once lay, 
And now, it echoes what I let go."
arts & sciences,TRUE,general,"
Stars chart the night’s uncertain mind, 
Data blooms where reason once did bind. 
A canvas holds the equations— 
Numbers sing a silent sonnet’s lines. 

Equations twist a brushstroke’s hue, 
Lab glass holds the sky’s uncertain blue. 
Circuits dream in chemical verse, 
A painter’s hand, a physicist’s curse. 

From atoms’ dance, a poet’s call— 
Theorems in a jazz improviser’s thrall. 
Lightning strikes the lab’s cold floor, 
As brushstrokes tremble with a conductor’s score. 

A hypothesis is painted white, 
As pigment blooms from test tube’s night. 
Quantum heart in prose unfurls— 
Doubt and wonder, science’s unceasing swirls. 

In every cell, a formula sings, 
As chords of art the world rewrites and brings. 
Through rigor’s fire and canvas’s flame, 
The arts and sciences share the same refrain. 

Arts and sciences, entwined in night, 
Refuse to split—each fuels the other’s light."
arts & sciences,TRUE,figurative,"
Brilliant patterns hum through silent glass, 
A mind’s deep question bends the math. 
Quantum whispers linger in the light— 
How reason weeps beneath the night. 

The canvas weeps in colors unconfined, 
While formulas chart the stars aligned. 
A violin’s cry dissolves in graphs— 
What longing hums behind each flash? 

Numbers hum a sorrow, cold and true, 
The painter’s hand the chaos drew. 
A question written in the starlight’s sigh— 
The answer’s shadow drifts along the sky. 

In equations, longing softly grows, 
While brushstrokes call the hidden flows. 
The artist’s grief the physicist shares— 
Two worlds entwined in silent air. 

The night repeats the morning’s quest, 
Where reason weeps and art confesses. 
Through equations and through pigment’s call— 
We search the heart of all, one and all."
arts & sciences,TRUE,specific,"
Moonlight pools on the microscope’s stage, 
A silent eye, a chemical dance. 
Glass slides remember every trace— 
Stains whisper where curiosity strays. 

Dance of atoms in a burning test, 
Electrons swirl to equations’ tune. 
Light bends, a prism cracks the sky, 
Color splintered, truth made new. 

Equations twist beneath the stars— 
Myth and logic, tangled in one frame. 
A lab notebook, ink still wet, 
Holds sorrow and the hope of fame. 

The lab’s cold hum, a midnight sigh, 
Circuits hum where heartbeats fail. 
Night bleeds science, hope, and blue— 
Moonlight pools again, unswayed."
christianity,TRUE,general,"


Steeple shadows whisper old regrets, 
Faith’s cracked mirror shows what was said. 
Hymns twist doubt like a healing net, 
Love’s chain both binds and is bled. 
 

A creed echoes in a shivering tune— 
Truth’s thorn pierces hearts I've always known. 
Martyr’s blood on marble, worn and new, 
Echoes call, but faith is overgrown. 

We kneel in hope, yet doubt the ground, 
Light flickers where the darkness broods. 
Sorrow’s hymn in every prayer— 
Silent tears in the cross’s shroud. 

 

Breath trembling between grace and guilt, 
I hear the river split its banks— 
Mourning and mercy in one lit 
Altar where the soul I am sank. 

 

O faith that claws at the edges of night, 
I wear your cross and yet run from light."
christianity,TRUE,figurative,"
Silent towers rise where hope was sown, 
Stone shadows whisper what the heart has known. 
A river bends, searching for the shore— 
Promises etched, but the current roars. 

Belief like dusk, both light and shade, 
Fading, enduring—never the same. 
Chains of ritual, a dance with pain, 
Yet hands reach upward, toward grace’s trail. 

Prayers are echoes in the hollow air, 
Dreams folded small, delivered nowhere. 
We count the hours, waiting for the dawn, 
When grace might linger, or has gone. 

Sorrow hums a hymn through midnight’s veil, 
Light flickers dimly through the midnight trial. 
In silence, grace and doubt entwine— 
The heart’s refrain: forever I’ll pine. 

But hope, a spark, refuses to die— 
It flickers still, though night is nigh."
christianity,TRUE,specific,"Silent cold, the December air 
Bell’s shiver splits the twilight’s veil. 
Memory rings—what ghosts arise? 
Hymn’s dust settles, hope or despair. 

Twelve chimes echo, trembling blue, 
A hymn’s shadow now the morning sees. 
My heart, a drum, unsure—yet true— 
Is faith just trembling in these trees? 

Cold stone walls remember each call 
But only silence answers my prayer. 
Echoes linger, heavy, tall— 
Are mercy’s notes or only care? 

The moment’s ghost in stained-glass light 
Blurs sacred and sorrow’s bite. 
Bells repeat, yet meaning slight— 
Love’s shape lost, yet still in the night. 

Within the echo, doubt and grace 
Wrest in the hollow of this place. 
Now dawn arrives, with gentle face— 
The bell’s last note returns my trace. 
"
chronic illness,TRUE,general,"
Cicatric whispers coil in dusk’s slow blue, 
A shiver’s tune, the ache turns midnight hue. 
Yet hope’s thin thread, though frayed, still hums— 
A weary ballad where the pain’s no sum. 

Grief’s low moan, the body’s restless cry, 
Mirror in shadows where the future lies. 
A river bends, but still flows ever on— 
Its current murmurs, though the banks are gone. 

Time’s slow pulse, a drum with hollow tone, 
Each breath a question, soft as evening’s stone. 
Still, in the hush, a star will break the blue— 
Lighting the dark where sorrow once grew. 

Though every night the sickness claims its toll, 
I hold the memory of the days that glow. 
From ashes born a fragile, stubborn flame— 
This ache becomes a hymn, not just a name. 

And in the end the ache will turn to song, 
Where pain and hope, in one breath, belong. 
Cicatric whispers coil in dusk’s slow blue"
chronic illness,TRUE,figurative,"
Bones hum a slow, midnight refrain, 
Echoes of absence in each vein. 
Night’s heavy hand presses light away— 
A whisper shapes the waking day. 

Day’s shadow slides through silent rooms, 
Where hope and fear in fragile tunes. 
Her laughter, thin as fractured glass, 
Holds memories of days now passed. 

Time’s river bends, no current flows— 
The clock’s cold heart refuses it knows. 
Yet in the ache, a fragile grace 
Grows through the cracks of measured space. 

You wander gardens of fading bloom, 
Where colors whisper what they can’t omit. 
Each breath a thread, uncertain, thin— 
Weaving patterns on the skin. 

The moon, a witness, weeps in light, 
As sorrow and resolve entwine tonight. 
Within this house of aching air, 
There’s music rising from despair. 

The body’s song, though broken, never dies— 
It hums the truth beneath closed eyes."
chronic illness,TRUE,specific,"

 The old lung’s cracked mirror, always reflecting dusk 
 Yet daylight leaks in, blue as a bruise, uninvited

 But sometimes, a whisper stirs, like a cough in a dream 
 Rattlesnake heart, trapped in a cage of bones 
 Memory hums a slow, aching tune 
 Each breath a note, flat and wrong 
 Blues run in my veins, a river with no mouth 
 The medicine bottle, yellowed and heavy on the nightstand 
 My mother’s hand, steady as a shadow, tracing the lines 
 That map of weakness, inked in time 
 I hold the silence, but it presses back—relentless 
 I am the clockwork, ticking out the ache, and the hope

crime & punishment,TRUE,general,"
Guilt’s shadow crawls through midnight’s blue 
The judge’s gavel writes a story new 
Night hums a tune where justice dies— 
Blood on bricks beneath the city’s eyes. 

Bricks echo sorrow with a heavy sigh 
A thief weeps gold for a world that lies 
Each breath a count, each moment a chain— 
The past’s cold hand still pulls me again. 

Fangs of remorse gnash in silent air 
Mercy’s whisper: “Bear the weight, beware.” 
The law’s cold hand drops a heavy stone 
Yet in the dusk, hope flickers alone. 

Midnight trains whisper through broken glass 
Echoes of crimes that time will pass 
Still, the heart pays where the law won’t see— 
Justice sharp, but mercy sets me free. 

Stone and soul in a trembling dance

Between the done and what might be mine.

Dimmed lanterns whisper secrets unsaid, 
A judge’s gavel echoes, heavy and dread. 
Yet hope, a ghost, floats in the cell’s deep gloom— 
It whispers, “Breathe, though chains bind you soon.” 

Steel bars echo sorrow’s ancient song, 
The past bleeds through every broken throng. 
Justice weeps rivers through cracked stone— 
Is mercy just a phantom, not its own?

Requiem sung for all the sinned confesses."

Steel hook, cold barbed edge— 
A moment etched in iron grief. 
Chain’s whisper, midnight air— 
No comfort here, only despair. 
Steel’s promise, sharp and unkind, 
Reduces soul to bone and mind. 

Mind’s echo, a prison cell— 
Each thought a crime the heartcell tell. 
Judgment’s shadow on the wall, 
Walls that absorb the falling call. 
Suffering’s rhythm, slow and deep, 
Like a blues that will not sleep. 

Again, the hook in trembling hand, 
Justice’s bite on skin, demand. 
Night’s weight, the reckoning due— 
No mercy found in this blue.

Each return whispers, yet hides death. 

Return again, the river bends in rain, 
Pain and hope loop in the soil’s veins. 
Steel and silk, the seasons’ arms entwine— 
What’s lost is drawn in the next design. 

Clockwork hearts beat, then slow and cease, 
Fading forms in the trembling freeze.

A refrain that the dusk must renew. 

Cycles turn, but I cannot sleep— 
The weight of years within my keep.

A shadowed path bends, then straightens again. 
Tides whisper secrets only time will know— 
We loop in the space between the when and the where."

Cogs in dusk repeat the night’s old turn, 
A wheel’s sigh, a shadow’s iron dance,

Again it pours, the same black sand flows, 
Yet each refill hides the one I left behind;

The cup—same shape, but memories rise— 
Echoes in the glass, in the turning eyes."

Irony, soft, threads the trembling air, 
Hope’s bruise blooms where reason dares not dare. 

Whispers turn to rivers, slow and deep, 
Night’s hunger hums a ragged, aching keep. 
You twist the words I thought I’d never say, 
Yet longing finds you in the fractured gray. 

Echoes dance, a waltz of want and loss, 
Each step a question, each a shattering cross. 
Your shadow slips beneath the lamp’s low gleam— 
I chase the ache you leave behind, unseen. 

The moon weeps silver on the fractured glass, 
A blues refrain, a sonnet’s fading mass. 
Through fire and frost, I call your name again— 
You are the ache, and I the trembling vein."
desire & passion,TRUE,specific,"
Glossy lips pressed to a brass-lid fan, 
Whispers fan the dusk’s sultry skin— 
A stolen glance, a burning lamp, 
Sweat blooms where longing begins. 

Lamp flickers, lost in shadowed pan, 
Shadowed pan, a hunger unblanched— 
Tongues map the shape of your hand, 
Mapping desire’s restless chords. 

Hand trembles in the velvet dance, 
Velvet dance, a rhythm unclaimed— 
Your name, a whisper in the trance, 
A whisper, yet the storm is named. 

Storm trembles, glass cracks the rhyme, 
Rhyme shatters—your passion disclaims— 
Glass cradles what the night time 
Time can’t cage in the echo of flames. 

Flames echo, the fan’s slow sigh, 
Sigh held back, yet burning high— 
Desire’s pulse, in the midnight’s eye, 
Midnight’s eye, it claims what it cannot deny. 

Names clash in the breathless air— 
Breathless air, a lover’s despair— 
Lips remember the heat there, 
Heat there, where longing despair. 

A clock’s trembling second hand, 
Second hand, the moment’s command— 
Desire’s grip, both gentle and span— 
Gentle grip, yet passion’s demand. 

Demand blooms in the silent room, 
Silent room, a shadow’s doom— 
Your shadow lifts the trembling gloom 
To aching light, forbidden bloom. 

Bloom unfurls where fingers meet, 
Fingers meet, a trembling beat— 
Beat echoes the pulse we keep, 
We keep the fire’s unkept seat. 

Seat of fire, the fan’s slow sigh, 
Sigh rekindles the passion’s eye— 
Desire, in echo, will not die; 
Die, yet live in this mirrored sky."
doubt & contemplation,TRUE,general,"
Silent shadow dances where belief might reside, 
A whisper of questions I can’t quite deny. 
Yet dusk in my mind carries a borrowed sigh— 
Bright hope dissolves in the hush of my eyes. 

A fractured memory echoes what I was told: 
Was faith a promise, or just a story retold? 
Now every echo in the hollow of my soul 
Bends the truth I once dared to hold. 

The moon’s pale cry weeps in the midnight blue, 
As doubt’s slow tide pulls at every old truth. 
Its rhythm hums low, a broken-down tune— 
A blues-inflected ache in the still night’s hue. 

I question the path that my trembling feet trace, 
Is certainty just the mind’s fragile embrace? 
Or do the stars, in their wandering space, 
Still light the way through my restless face? 

Beneath the trembling dusk, I search for ground, 
Where certainty and uncertainty entwine. 
A flicker of certainty, then doubt’s design 
Wraps gently around heart and encircling sound. 

In this echo of doubt, I find my frame— 
Not lost, but searching, shaped by pain and shame. 
Yet somewhere deep, a whisper says I name 
The courage needed to bear life’s blame. 

Through shadow and song, I wander the line 
Where truth and doubt, like twin rivers, align— 
Each ripple a question I’ll not define, 
Yet in the flow, my heart’s meaning entwines. 

And so doubt, and doubt’s contemplation stay, 
A mirror where light and shadow both play— 
I wonder, I doubt, and I still say: 
The question remains, though the night turns gray."
doubt & contemplation,TRUE,figurative,"
Moonlight pools on silent questions left unsaid, 
A shadow dances where the truth has fled. 
Glass eyes reflect the path I never took, 
Echoes murmur where resolve is shook. 

Night hums low a lonesome, restless tune, 
A train whistle cries the answer soon. 
Yet in the stillness, hope is softly spun— 
Hope’s thread unwinds, uncertain, but begun. 

Whispers curl from windows, cold and thin, 
A river bends within the evening’s skin. 
Mist remembers what the daylight won’t— 
The shape of things I thought I’d never know. 

I hear my voice, a stranger in the hall, 
Repeating doubts the heart makes call. 
Each step a question, never sure or small— 
The answer lies in what I dare to fall. 

Darkness weaves a cobweb through the night, 
Still I search for stars that might ignite. 
The road ahead is paved with faint light— 
Or is it just the echo of last night? 

Within this silence, storms of feeling rise, 
A trembling melody that never dies. 
I sing the ache the moment tries to hide, 
But let the notes of sorrow gently bide. 

The night becomes a mirror, clear and deep, 
Where longing and resolve in union sleep. 
Though shadows linger where my courage slips, 
The dawn will come with secrets I might keep. 

(And so the night returns to where it began— 
A question asked, but never quite answered.)"
doubt & contemplation,TRUE,specific,"A chipped porcelain teacup, cold in my palm, 
Froths doubts, a circle, never to unspill. 
Yet on this table, sunlight cracks the glass— 
Reflections blur where the past and now pass. 

Glass holds what is lost, and what is imagined; 
A spill remembered—did it ever happen? 
The clock ticks slow, but time bends back to see 
If hope or regret were ever just for me. 

But shadows whisper, shifting shapes unseen— 
Is this remembrance, or a dream within? 
Each mark upon the wood recalls what’s gone; 
Yet doubt remains—my only constant song. 

Within this doubt, my heart finds fragile peace— 
Memory’s echo in a glassy freeze. 
A teacup’s doubt, the table’s silent plea— 
And always, doubt is where I choose to be."
family & ancestors,TRUE,general,"
Ghosts in the hearth, my blood’s old refrain, 
A mother’s shadow, bent with time. 
Yet somewhere, laughter cracks the chain— 
I sing her name, a borrowed chime. 

Mama’s eyes hold rivers, deep and slow, 
A story etched in knuckles, rough and wise. 
But my own hands may yet let the past go— 
New soil beneath my restless feet. 

Still, whispers curl where memory grows, 
Unquiet roots, defiant and alive. 
The past is not a cage, just a stone 
That shapes the well where my tears arrive. 

Each ancestor, a note in the refrain, 
A song half-sung, half-forgotten. 
I carry their light, yet cannot contain 
The ache of being what I’ve been. 

Yet in the night, a whispered name remains— 
A bridge between what was, and what I’ve made. 
Through generations, love and sorrow wane, 
But echo still in every shade. 

The bloodline hums, a fragile, broken hymn, 
Love’s wild tune beneath the weathered skin. 
I hold the past, but let it begin 
Again and again, within."
family & ancestors,TRUE,figurative,"
Shadows gather at the hearth's old light, 
A whispered name in the cracked window pane— 
Each story’s weight, a thread in the night, 
Unfolds as the river turns to rain. 
Within the walls, a song half-remembered, 
Echoes the hands that shaped my bone; 
Roots twist deep where sorrow’s river’s bent, 
Yet sorrow’s breath makes new earth overgrown. 
A face in the mirror, time’s slow tide, 
Wears grief like a crown it cannot remove— 
From your eyes, a storm I inherit, wide, 
But hope still hums where my heart tries to move. 
The past leans close, a cold familiar hand, 
But my voice answers, fierce and stand."
family & ancestors,TRUE,specific,"
A chipped porcelain bowl sits on the windowsill, 
Its faded blue glaze holds stories of mother’s hands, 
Each crack a map of laughter, spilled and still— 
Yet time, like water, slips through ancient sands. 
 
Bowl and memory, strangers in the light, 
Yet I see them side by side in every meal; 
My father’s voice, a low refrain at night, 
Reminds me how the past is gently revealed. 
 

Cracked, it endures; its beauty is in flaw, 
A vessel holding generations’ salt and song. 
Ancestors’ whispers cling in every scar, 
Echoing in the cracks where love belongs. 
 

In this bowl I find their patience, their delight— 
Their presence, a blue stain I cannot erase. 
And so I serve their memory, still in flight, 
Returning to the bowl that holds their trace."

Gender’s shadow dances on the wall, 
A shifting rhythm, blue as a call, 
A whisper, a moan, a question in air— 
Is identity only what we wear? 

Walls echo the voices I can’t name, 
Blues hum through every borrowed game. 
Specters of roles drift, dissolve and rise— 
Flesh bends to colors that won’t comply. 

Masks slide, unfasten, then tighten again, 
Soul’s fire flickers in a borrowed frame. 
What’s true when the world demands a line? 
Silent storms, or rivers of wine? 

Tides of desire twist in hidden streams— 
Hearts split by borders that never gleam. 
A cry escapes where labels grow thin— 
Can love’s shape be measured or spin? 

Echoes return, but the question remains: 
Where do we find selves when roles transform? 
Mirror’s gaze holds a fractured whole— 
Gender’s and sexuality’s secret soul. 
Echoes return, yet we keep asking—how?

Flickers of light, shadows assume new names, 
Night hums a tune where the boundaries flame. 

Names dissolve like smoke in a shifting breeze, 
Whispers of want, unspoken, please. 

The moon weeps silver, uncertain of roles, 
Shadows and light in a restless soul. 

Blues hum low in the marrow of bone, 
Fears tangled up, yet the pulse wants to run. 

A question drawn in the ink of a sigh, 
Love’s tides twist and turn, hiding why. 

Echoes of self in a thousand faces, 
Masked and unveiled in the shifting places. 

The world’s gaze bends, but the heart stands tall— 
Silent vows, broken, or waiting to call.

The Fates spin thread, but Jove laughs, untold, 
As Dione whispers secrets to the stone— 
A lover’s curse, a father’s cold gold, 
And shadows of the past that overgrow. 
Rivers run with Tantalus’s thirst, 
Yet Venus weeps in gardens unrepentant—

Ovid’s quill chases gods through broken 
Horizons, rewriting fate’s disguise. 

Juno’s storm binds fate in silent chains, 
But Mars, half-angel, stirs the restless earth; 
Sisyphus laughs, his curse un restrains— 
Time’s wheel turns, etching sorrow’s worth. 

Aphrodite’s mirror, broken, still gleams—

Apollo's shadow falls, a heavy sigh, 
His chariot's wheels hum the laments of why. 

Branch now, I bear the blush she dared to wear, 
Roots cradle sorrow, ancient as despair. 
Spirits wander, whispering her lost name, 
While leaves remember where love took such blame. 

The oak remembers what the gods remade— 
Her cry still echoes in the dusk's shade. 
Boughs twist with longing, ache with unseen cost, 
A blue note rises from the tangled host. 

Yet in the silver sheen, her story stays— 
A branch that holds the tears of ancient days. 
Branch now I am, yet I still hear her call— 
The laurel tree weeps what it cannot fall.

Iron and ink carve history’s scarred spine, 
A ledger’s lie, a shadowed design. 
Yet voices rise from ash and chain, 
Dancing grief in a political rain. 

Chains of truth or the siren’s rhyme? 
We wear their masks, yet secretly— 
Each generation wears a time, 
A borrowed crown that history assigns. 

Wounds remember, even as they hide— 
A song of sorrow in the news. 
From ruins built, the past still climbs, 
A pendulum between rage and compromise. 

We name the dead, but silence screams: 
The past is not a story, just a wound. 
And every vote—like history’s dream— 
Is a step toward what could be unbound. 

Yet echoes call from the bones of stone, 
Where truth and fiction waltz as one, 
We sing our sorrow, our hope alone, 
And history’s shadow grows until we’re done."

A whisper turns to thunder in the coal. 
Bloodlines remember battles long since done, 
Yet new flags rise on winds that never run. 

Voices chant the myths of faded kings, 
But every vote is fire that time can bring. 
We carve our names in stone, then forget— 
O scar that lingers, where the truth was met. 

The river bends through battles and through ink, 
Its currents carry ghosts that never sink. 
A song of wounds, yet hope still sings— 
The tale repeats, but hearts still spring."

Light pools where memories flow. 
Yet every echo finds the wall— 
It cracks with longing, then falls. 

Furniture bears the weight of years, 
Shadows dance in silent fears. 
Hope and loss in one thread spin, 
A quilt stitched from what’s been within. 

The porch creaks, a lonesome sigh, 
Echoes of laughter, gone by. 
Blue dusk settles on the pane— 
Home is the ache that will not explain. 

Night repeats the morning’s hue, 
The cycle spins in what we renew. 
We build our peace in fractured light— 
Home is both the shelter and the blight."

Lament for the walls that never close. 

Floorboards creak a tale that the wind repeats, 
Echoes spin a yarn I can’t deny. 
Scent of bread and laughter, long gone cold— 
Curtains sigh as if they’ve known the night. 

Bulldogs’ shadows cross the fading light, 
Footsteps ghost the dust I used to know. 
A kettle’s sigh, a melody out of place, 
Bridges built of silent tears, not bone.

Each room a map I wander, lost and found— 
The heart’s old house, its echo still with me."

A key, forgotten, yet demands the night, 
Like a whisper from a mother’s half-remembered sigh, 
It twists in silence, refusing to take flight, 
Yet beckons hope that’s drowned in the blue of the eye. 

That relic of access, so worn and slight, 
Mirrors the tension between holding on tight 
And letting go, letting the house exhale 
Its secrets with the damp and the light. 

Hold fast to the past, or let it slowly fade— 
The key under the sink, in the duel we made, 
Still waits beneath, where memory and loss reside, 
Where home is both door and the locked place inside."

A trembling ember flickers in midnight’s breath, 
Yet dawn’s uncertain shadow whispers new death. 
Its promise bends like rain, both wet and dry, 
A river’s ache where future’s current lies. 

Promise— 
A ghost in the gutter, singing low, 
Not gold, but the ache that wants to grow. 

In the gravel of longing, it finds its way, 
A shiver of dawn that refuses to stay. 
Yet somewhere deep, a seed in darkness sown— 
Hope, again, in the heart that’s been broken. 

I begin what I’ll end in the trembling light, 
Hope’s echo—soft, fierce, and nearly right."

Morning might find its gentle ease. 

The wind whispers what the dusk confessed— 
A song in the cracks of my mind. 
Yet somewhere, a distant door is pressed— 
By longing, or by some future kind. 

Fading light dances on the wall, 
But whispers persist in the air— 
A melody that will not fall, 
But climbs up, uncertain, to declare: 

That even when the night falls low, 
The ember’s call will rise again; 
Though storms may howl, I’ll know— 
New dawn is waiting, though I’ve been dim."
hope,TRUE,specific,"
Sparrow’s trembling wing at dusk, 
A flicker—fragile, just a blur— 
Yet in its shadow, dusk’s hushes trust 
And whispers of a rising stir. 

Shadow becomes a broken lyre, 
Its strings stretched thin by evening’s sigh— 
I pluck the ache, but hope still fires, 
A stubborn ember in the sky. 

Lyre’s notes melt to a slow river, 
Carrying old sorrow, soft and deep— 
But currents turn where hope’s blue river 
Swims, daring darkness to let sleep. 

In cracked glass, hope’s reflection bends, 
A half-formed promise in the pane— 
It glows with longing, then transcends 
To dust and dawn’s uncertain reign. 

Yet in that glint, somewhere inside, 
Hope is both wound and silent song— 
It waits, it aches, and yet it’s tied 
To every fragile, trembling throng. 

And so it rises, again and again, 
A spark within the falling night— 
Hope—unseen, but fierce as rain, 
Woven through the world’s abrupt light."

Blood and breath sing of gods on the plain, 
A wolf’s old song licks the edge of rain, 
Iron shoes shuffle in emerald mist, 
Where forgotten kings dance in the mist. 

Whispered names linger in every stone— 
A child’s breath stirs the roots down below, 
Echoes claim the world as their own, 
A thousand voices sing the same slow. 

Night repeats the first in its cold refrain, 
And hope is the spider’s own twisted chain."

Ceramic owl, silent guardian of the hearth's old flame, 
Moonlight etches its hollow eyes with haunted aim. 
Hearth, your warmth now cold in shadow's whispering claim— 
A hollow gaze returns, silent as a name. 

Name etched in dust where ancient hands once played, 
A fable's promise lost in every splintered shade. 
Fable whispers, fractured, through the evening's grey, 
Yet memory still hums, a ghost in the stayed. 

Folklore's breath lingers in the cracked tile's grain, 
Unseen hands once shaped the terror of pain. 
Now dust remembers, but the story remains— 
A tale that echoes, unbroken by rain. 

Owl's gaze meets silence, the past in its wings, 
And the hearth, though cold, holds the echo of things. 
In broken tales and silent stone, the truth takes wing— 
And the owl watches, while the fire still sings."

A storm’s sigh melts the silent dew. 
Moss and stone, their silent pact— 
Roots entwine, refuse to break that.

Branches bow, the wind’s slow claim, 
Reflections bloom in liquid flame. 
Mountains sigh in distant grey, 
Yet rivers sing their urgent way.

Thorns protect what the light does see, 
Yet shadows weave their wild mystery. 
Sap and frost—each other’s refrain— 
Life and decay in balance remain.

Cicadas hum a summer hymn, 
But winter’s breath grows sharp and grim. 
The earth remembers what it’s sown, 
A green heartbeat beneath the moon.

In the hush where light and dark contend, 
Nature’s pulse echoes, never ends— 
For roots and sky in endless trade 
Find beauty tangled in the shade.

Moonlight stitches night to the wind’s din 
Shadows stretch where the grass has grown— 
They dance alone, yet never alone 

The mountain’s sigh, a low harmonica 
Breathes through pines in a languid aria 
Wind writes a letter on trembling pine 
Each branch a note in the twilight’s sign 

Clouds drift slow, a mournful melody

Waters run slow, a slow blues refrain 
Echoes call from the silent plain 

I walk the hush where earth is drawn—

Silence sings the dusk away

Ripples become a slow refrain, 
A shiver in the dusk’s soft blue, 
Now echo, now a call in pain— 
The sky dissolves in colors I pursue. 
 

Water holds a breath, suspended time, 
A trembling note in nature’s tune— 
Each ripple, a forgotten rhyme, 
A longing, unclaimed by the moon. 
 

The sun sinks, a slow reluctant sigh, 
Its image blurs, yet never dies; 
In glassy eyes the world lies low— 
Stillness holds the moment I outgrow.

A memory both seen and untold— 
In ripples mirrored, hearts unfold 
As dusk completes the story told."
power,TRUE,general,"
Power shapes what the world will know, 
A current cloaked in shadowed glow. 
Yet in its flow, the silence grows— 
A whisper, or a storm that breaks below. 

Light bends to its invisible hand, 
And hope can shatter, or be planned. 
Still, it bends the heart, demand and stand. 
A fist of wind, a gentle land. 

Shadows wield it without voice, 
They carve in silence what they choose. 
Yet power’s cost is measured ice— 
A price the soul must freely lose. 

Through fire’s glare or shadowed night, 
It craves to live, to burn, to fight. 
Yet in its hold, both king and slight— 
We find ourselves, and lose the light. 

The echoes call with iron tone, 
We answer, broken, or become. 
Still, power’s echo lingers on— 
What began must end, but not be gone. 

We shape our fate, yet fate still shapes 
The weight of power in our days. 
Through every chain, new seeds are sown— 
Power is born where fear and hope are grown. 

So let it rise, let it descend, 
A riddle spun from every end. 
For power’s game is endless round— 
And in its turn, our selves are found."

Iron in hands, silent thunder grows,

Hands that shape what darkness fears— 
Now unshaped, dissolve in trembling tears. 

A whisper spins a spinning wheel, 
A heavy cloak that’s shed and feels. 
Time’s weight slips through a trembling bone, 
A flicker—then the flame is gone. 

Gravity bends a silver tongue, 
Its song swallowed by the young. 
What is raised, in shadow set— 
A shadow dances, stepping wet. 

Steel-cold pulse beneath the skin, 
Veins map the roads of where we’ve been. 
Chains of memory, unbound, 
Find freedom in the trembling sound. 

Midnight hums a hollow tune, 
Echoes echo what the dawn won. 
A single note, a fractured hymn— 
We sing the silence, then begin. 

Now— 
The echo calls the starting point anew."

Dim light trembles in trembling hand, 
A whisper chases down the stair, 
Not comfort, only silent command— 
My shadow swallows what is there. 
Hand that grips the shivering ray 
Shakes with the weight of hope or dread, 
The flashlight’s glow both guides and sways, 
A small authority it spread. 

Its beam reveals, but never stays, 
A ghostly path that seems to fade, 
Yet in the dark I still believe 
It could ignite the way ahead. 

Still, the steps remember every foot, 
They bear the marks of light and loss— 
A borrowed strength, unsure, a doubt 
That flickers as the journey grows. 
Each flash, a promise—half-bright, half-spent— 
In darkness, power flickers, then is spent. 
Dim light trembles in trembling hand."
poetry & poets,TRUE,general,"
Silent ink, poets carve their doubts— 
A whisper bends a spoken vow. 
Each stanza’s shadow, deep as night, 
Unfolds a longing, not quite right. 

Ink and iron in a poet’s hand, 
A trembling truth they dare command. 
The page, a stage where voices play— 
A blues refrain in every sway. 

The meter’s ache, the rhyme’s refrain, 
Are ghosts that poets feel in pain. 
They sculpt with words what feelings say, 
Yet ache in knowing poetry’s way. 

A ghazal’s longing in a blues moan, 
A sonnet’s close where hope is gone. 
Poets drift between the lines— 
Where meaning bends and meaning twines. 

The pen, a blade that cuts and sings, 
Unspools the soul where longing springs. 
Echoes call across the page— 
The poet’s self, a shifting cage. 

Within the form, a restless tide, 
Where heart and logic softly collide. 
For every word, a world is spun, 
But silence waits beneath the sun. 

Two voices echo, old and new: 
Poets dance with both the blue and true. 
In every verse, a mirror bends, 
And echoes shape the poet’s ends. 

And so the ink repeats its song— 
Poetry’s wound and poetry’s throng."

Silent ink, a restless tide, 
Words carve old wounds in new skin—

Echoes the pulse of my mind. 

A shadow laughs at the verse, 
A bluesman’s cry in the dusk— 
The meter bends, a fractured curse, 
Love and loss in each rough hush. 

Beneath my feet, a trembling rhyme 
Asks what the heart should confess— 
Each syllable, a borrowed time, 
A ghostly truth, half-dressed. 

The writer’s hand, a trembling blade, 
Cuts through the silence, raw and deep— 
But what remains? Only a shade 
Of the words that rhyme with sleep. 

Night hums the old refrain, 
A moan from the marrow of art— 
Is my voice a borrowed train 
Or the spark that burns from the heart? 

The rhyme in my throat, a thorn, 
A ghazal’s longing, unconfined— 
I sing the ache that I’ve worn, 
But the tune slips through my mind. 

In the space between breath and line 
The tension coils, sharp and bright— 
A poet’s shadow, my own sign, 
Or a lie in the cold night? 

The last note lingers, a tie, 
Torn threads of all I’ve tried— 
To shape the storm in my eye, 
Yet only silence replies."

The poet wept, but still time 
Wears sorrow’s velvet, drawn awash. 

A quill, heavy with longing’s ink, 
Once carved verses—now a sigh, 
Echoes hum where inspiration’s link 
Bends hope into a lonesome sky. 

In margins, a poet’s sigh—

Love’s ghost and the ink that tries 
To hold what slips through the unseen.

Silent grief across the land. 

Night whispers secrets, old and new, 
A sorrow stitched in every hue. 
Torn threads of hope, both raw and few,

Your laughter—shadows I chase— 
Flickers in the corners of light, 
A ghost with the taste of hate. 

You said, “Let me go,” but I stayed, 
Held by a memory’s chains— 
A broken hymn softly played. 

This heart’s old map is torn, 
Lines etched in a language of sighs, 
Where hope and regret are born. 

Within this hollowed stone 
Lies the echo of what we were— 
A slow waltz of love and scar. 

Love, a train I missed at dawn, 
Still rolls through the midnight train— 
I wait for the next call gone.

Storm clouds gather, dark and deep, 
Yet in the dusk I still weep.

But love, that absent note, repeats the refrain 
In threads that stitch the silent space again

Or bled, or paused, a question left behind— 
Yet that same hand now holds the other’s mind 

Through dusk’s low hum, the fabric softly weeps 
In patterns blue as a love that sleeps 
And wakes again in threads of fading light— 
We loop the ache where longing meets the night 

And so the fold, the tear, the pressed breath stay— 
A single truth both given and gone away."

Love’s ache unfurls like a worn guitar string; 
Each memory, a note, will never die— 
Yet I remember, you sing, 
You sing the ache I cannot hide. 

Desire’s slow tide, a river running cold, 
Flows backward in my dreams, a current I can’t swim. 
Your eyes, the map where all my hopes unfold— 
A compass points to you, and I… 
I drift toward you, yet never quite arrive. 

Holding your hand, I taste the unspoken rhyme, 
A melody that twists in longing’s sway, 
Your laughter lingers, leaving no time— 
We orbit, never quite to stay.

Your breath, a hymn I half-remember, 
Woven through the dark with steel strings. 

Night hums a low, uncertain tune

Your shadow stretches, longing for dawn, 
Yet I am fixed where you let go. 

The river bends, your reflection splits— 
Two currents, one name, an endless flow. 
I call your name, the water answers 
With echoes only you can show. 

If stars were made of whispered words, 
They’d sing your name in every dusk’s blue. 
In this quiet space where silence grows, 
Your absence blooms a phantom hue. 

Dust and longing swirl in twilight’s grip, 
A melody of what I almost keep. 
We are the echo, the refrain, the slip— 
A longing never meant to sleep.

Sorrow pools in midnight’s slow breath— 
A shadow’s sigh, heavy as death.

Roots clutching hope through fractured bones. 

Bones echo, whispering old grief, 
A mournful tune the night cannot leave. 
A whisper’s thread through silent rooms— 
How sorrow shapes what love once knew.

Still, in the ache, a distant light

Now echoes gather where laughter used to be 
And shadows dance in the blue-lit gray. 

Rooms of dust and quiet air 
Hold the weight of everything I said. 
No comfort whispers there— 
Only silence, heavy and unshed. 

I wander through the slow, slow rain 
Where memories drift like lost notes— 
Each drop a refrain, each pain 
A bridge I cross, yet still it floats. 

The clock’s slow hand etches midnight’s tale 
In lines I cannot rewrite or erase. 
What’s left is a pale veil 
And the ache that time cannot phase. 

Yet in the hollow of dusk’s last sigh 
A tiny light begins to shape 
A question soft beneath the sky— 
Is this the end or just the space? 

The river bends in the moon’s pale gaze 
Where sorrow’s shape dissolves and flows— 
But still, within its maze, I stay 
And wonder if the heart knows 
How to mend what it cannot hold. 

Still, in the hush before dawn breaks, 
I hear a voice, both near and far— 
A whisper that the night mistakes 
For hope, or simply the star. 

For loss is both a door and a wall, 
A note unfinished, half-unplayed. 
Yet somewhere, perhaps, we all 
Learn how to grieve, though the words stay 
Unspoken, folded in the night."

Like grief that pools inside my empty throat, 
Still flows, relentless, though I’d wish it wouldn’t. 
Within this vessel, silence learned to weep, 
A mournful echo in the chipped rim— 
What was once warmth now holds a cold refrain, 
And longing finds a home in each thin rim. 
This sorrow’s echo, round and round it spins— 
A teacup’s shadow mourns the sun’s descent."

City glass reflects what we wear— 
Yet masks peel, truth’s undercurrents flare.

But masks shift, and secrets twist again. 

Echoes call in subway’s blue haze, 
Where hope and doubt wander day by day. 
We chant the same old words, yet mean 
Different things when silence is between. 

Hands raised high in protest’s prayer— 
Yet iron chains still bind the air. 
Chalkboards etch what time can’t erase, 
But stories fade as quickly as grace. 

We paint our dreams on walls for all, 
Yet shadows gather in the hall. 
The past whispers through every screen— 
A future built on what we’ve seen. 

Each headline shouts, a lie we share, 
But in the cracks, the real pain’s there. 
We’re singing blues for broken streets, 
Yet longing for the promise these meet. 

In every heart, a question grows— 
Who shapes the world, as hope outpours? 
Through windows cracked and screens so bright, 
We trade our truths for fleeting light. 

And when the night returns to fold 
The city’s story, old and cold— 
We see the same old glass, again, 
But maybe, just this time, we’ll begin.

Old wounds bloom with new, unyielding grace—

Each knuckle aches, a whispered page 
Of lessons learned when the world set me free. 

Chains of words, not just of iron fast, 
My thoughts loop back where the struggle began. 
But hope, stubborn, flickers in the vast 
Dark, a spark that refuses to be fan. 

Beneath the weight, my eyes find sky— 
A sliver of light, defiant, unbroken.

Love’s promise broken, yet I stay— 
Truth’s echo lingers all day. 
Though I weep for what was lost and found, 
In silence, truth is gently sound."
truth,TRUE,figurative,"
A whisper bends in every mirror, 
Shadows dance, but names don't linger— 
Reflections falter, masks are worn, 
Yet what you hide still shapes the storm. 

Storms brew where words are swallowed deep, 
Echoes turn the silent streets to sleep; 
But sleep is fragile, fragile as the sigh 
That pulls the veil from each divided eye. 

A sigh becomes a heavy chain, 
 link the heart to what it cannot explain; 
Hope is the cost of breaking free— 
A note repeated in a midnight key. 

Midnight hums with fractured rhyme, 
Two hearts echo in a borrowed time; 
The path I tread, I never see— 
The map is drawn by what I let slip free. 

Key of longing, note of doubt, 
Twined in every breath I recollect— 
Yet in the echo, something is found: 
A question left unspoken, deeply trodden."
truth,TRUE,specific,"A single tear splits the faded frame, 
Truth’s ghost lingers, half-concealed, half-claimed. 
But hope insists, the glass still gleams— 
A silence where a story remains. 

Silence is a blade that cuts and heals, 
Yet that wound, a story the light reveals. 
The paper’s tear, a question left unsaid— 
Is memory a wound or just a thread? 

Memory stitches what time erases, 
But what is left is only half the phase. 
Can truth survive the edges it abhors? 
Or only haunt what the mind ignores? 

The border frays, yet holds its line— 
A truth both broken, still divine. 
So here I stand: the past, the tear, the frame— 
Same moment, yet in two different names."
twilight,TRUE,general,"
Twilight licks the sky in bruised sighs, 
A slow moan where indigo and violet lie. 
Distant heartbeats hum the fading light— 
A blues refrain dissolves in shadowed night. 

Night draws the dusk into its trembling hand, 
While hope, a whisper, stirs across the land. 
Yet dusk, relentless, folds the day’s last call— 
A ghazal’s longing in the twilight’s pall. 

Light leaks through cracks in the horizon’s seam, 
Each ripple splits the pulse of evening’s dream. 
But hearts remember the day’s departing grace— 
Echoed sorrow in the mirrored space. 

Through veils of color, longing softly bleeds, 
A shiver of sorrow the dusk never hides. 
Yet twilight holds us: a trembling embrace— 
Twilight, again, as we repeat this phase."
twilight,TRUE,figurative,"
Rivers of dusk slide through my veins 
A sigh becomes a trembling train 
Crickets hum a broken refrain 
Night’s breath seeps through the paper chains 

Chains of shadow, silent and deep 
Light is a tear that softly keeps 
A lonely heart’s secret sleep 
Yet hope’s thin thread the night sustains 

Thread of gold through velvet gloom 
Fading hopes in a slow room 
Every shadow learns to bloom 
Despite the ache, the stars remain 

Through hushed blue valleys I wander 
Where silence and fire are one 
Echoes linger, never banter 
A yearning held in the moon 

Moonlight’s question, unasked 
Echoes the path I have missed 
But in the hush I am blessed— 
I find the answer within the mist"
twilight,TRUE,specific,"
Glimmer cracks the bruised sky— 
A streetlamp’s sigh, not quite blue, 
Night folds its pocketed wings, 
Yet hope leaks a slow, bruised hue. 
 

Light bends to shadow’s tongue— 
Reflections swallow the street, 
I hear my voice in the glass, 
A mournful tune I can’t keep. 
 

A flicker, then a sigh— 
The world holds its breath in doubt, 
My heart’s old hymn, half-sung, 
Half the ache that the dusk routs. 
 

Each glow is a memory’s bruise, 
It burns then fades, a slow refrain— 
Echoes of light, the midnight blues, 
Drown in the dusk’s uncertain train. 
 

 

The alley’s sigh, the streetlight’s sigh— 
We meet where the day lets go; 
And in the flicker’s slow reply, 
We find what we almost know."
urban environment,TRUE,general,"
Steel towers hum midnight hymns, 
Concrete veins pulse with restless sleep. 
Horizon’s shadow slips, unseen— 
Glass eyes watch the city weep. 
 

Glass eyes see, but never know, 
The ghosts that wander below. 
As trains hiss on cold rails’ song, 
The heart of streets grows overgrown. 

Night’s breath lingers, heavy and slow, 
Echoes call where the traffic flows. 
Beneath neon’s flickering sigh, 
Hope and loss drift side by side. 

 

In every window, a silent plea— 
Light fights darkness, wild and free. 
Yet somewhere, roots reach deep below 
To claim what the city lets go."
urban environment,TRUE,figurative,"
Steel bones hold my heart in glass and stone, 
Windows see the city, silent and alone. 
Glass reflects the ache beneath the street, 
Where footsteps echo what the night will meet. 

The air is thick with voices I don’t know, 
A hum that whispers, yet the silence grows. 
Walls breathe shadows where the light turns blue— 
Each brick a story only I can view. 

Chains of cars, a river running slow, 
Carrying hopes that never seem to go. 
Smoke and neon blur the distant line, 
Where hope and worry tangled intertwine. 

Clouds of exhaust, the sky is bruised and gray, 
Night’s blue fire burning on the way. 
My footsteps lost in the concrete maze, 
A search for comfort in this endless phase. 

Echoes call from alleys deep and dim, 
Where broken dreams still find a place to grim. 
Streetlights flicker, soft as fading hymns— 
The city sighs, and I begin again. 

Night’s blue tide lifts the silent streets, 
Memories float where the concrete beats. 
The concrete sings a low, familiar tune, 
A song of loss and of the found and loom. 

Here I return, as I began anew— 
The city’s pulse is both my pain and you."
urban environment,TRUE,specific,"


 Neon sign flickers, red and blue, 
 Blue becomes a memory’s hue— 
 Blue your shadow lingers at dawn, 
 Memory the light grows cold and gone. 

 Glass window, cracked and old, 
 Old reflects a story told— 
 Story the hum of a delivery truck, 
 Hum a lullaby the night just punk’d. 

 Punk’d hope, yet still the tea burns warm, 
 Warm in cups on a wet, iron arm— 
 Arm of the streetlamp, weathered and tough, 
 Tough I sip, lost in the city hush. 

 Hush that holds my longing’s sigh— 
 Sigh line of the neon sign why. 
"
war & conflict,TRUE,general,"
Steel echoes in the night’s thin air, 
A whisper cuts through the battlefield’s stare. 
From peace’s forgotten promise torn, 
We build walls where hope was once worn. 

Walls shift, their stones murmuring old grief, 
Like a bluesman’s cry, the pain is brief— 
Yet sorrow lingers, deep as the mud, 
A ghazal of hearts lost, unspurded. 

No battle ends with a trumpet’s call, 
But shadows linger where the guns fall. 
We write letters we’ll never send, 
To a world that’s already gone, pretending— 

The world’s a broken chessboard, 
Each move written in blood and sorrow. 
Yet echoes of laughter, half-heard, 
In silence, call back to where we’re forbid. 

We fight not for gold, but for space— 
A home made of ash in the war’s embrace. 
And when dawn comes, the lines blur the same, 
The war remains in the echo of name."
war & conflict,TRUE,figurative,"
Shadows gather where the thunderous steel resounds, 
A silent hymn hums through the shattered ground. 
Echoes whisper what the rivers disowned— 
Winds recall the tears where hope was found. 

Steel and sorrow dance in an uneasy truce, 
Night’s black hymn hums where the gunfire uses. 
Blood becomes the map that memory reuse— 
A lonesome tune, unending, in blue hues. 

The battlefield’s breath echoes in the night, 
Each scar a refrain, each cry a lost light. 
Chains of dust bind the living with the tight— 
A trembling heart remembers the first fright. 

In the hush, the past and present blend— 
A soldier’s ghost sings a song unending. 
Love, like ash, lingers where the battle’s ended— 
Two hearts entwined, where the peace is bending."
war & conflict,TRUE,specific,"
Steel boots echo midnight's ache, 
A broken radio, static hum— 
Battlefields hum lullabies, 
Yet silence claws the bloodstained ground. 

The map, once ink, now tears and stains, 
A child’s chalk line, erased in light. 

Shouts fade to whispers in the sand, 
A helmet’s shadow, cold and round. 

Love’s hope dissolved in smoke and rain. 
Night’s bruised sky, the world gone blind. 

Yet in the mirror of old glass, 
We see the war reflected twice— 
Once in the wound, once in the kiss, 
A cycle never meant to end."
weather,TRUE,general,"
Rain hammers glass—no comfort, only glass. 
A sigh from thunder, seeking quiet in silence. 
Storm’s whisper rides the roof, a ghost in the shingle. 
Windows weep, reflecting what the sky will not. 

Clouds, heavy as regret, drift over pale fields. 
Hope hides in the light where rain never touches. 
My breath fogs the air, a slow, blue confession. 
Clouds unravel, letting dusk gently possess. 

Lightning stitches night with jagged, golden thread. 
I stand between storms and stillness, a guest in both. 
Echoes of rain ring—blues in the weathered wood. 
Again, the sky repeats: rain hammers glass."
weather,TRUE,figurative,"
Rain’s slow pulse on the glass, 
A blue and restless sigh— 
Your shadow stretches, lengthens, 
No, I see your eyes. 
Steam lifts from the wet street, 
Night’s breath in a sigh— 
Yet thunder calls, a borrowed hymn, 
I answer with silence. 
Each drop a question left unanswered, 
Lightning’s brief old friend. 
You asked for storm, but I brought dawn, 
It trembles, it bends. 
The air hums a broken tune— 
Rain repeats what it means."
weather,TRUE,specific,"
Wind’s cold wrist around my cheek— 
A shiver bends the glass pane, 
The window’s sigh, a fractured hymn, 
Echoes the storm’s distant train. 

Storm’s breath licks the low-hanging wire— 
A whisper tangled in the rain. 
My shadow stretches thin and wide, 
A fractured mirror, not the same. 

That old tin cup, its chipped rim 
Catches the gray and holds the blue. 
I sip the sorrow, sharp and thin, 
Yet taste the honey of the dew. 

This moment, suspended in the mist— 
A breath suspended, waiting for you. 
Yet in the hush, I still recall 
The rain’s first kiss on my shoe. 

The rain’s embrace, its fleeting claim, 
A lover’s touch that fades too soon; 
In its brief hold, I found release— 
And lingered lost in the blue moon."

The years turn pages, never done— 
 

 
Now laughter's ghost where hope was sown 
 

 
But shadows twist the seeds I’ve sown,

The clock’s slow drag, a heavy weight 
 

 
Yet I still chase the dawn’s first glow 
 

 
In every face the past is shown 
 

 
My heart’s old map, unfurled and torn 
 

 
Through twilight’s haze I still run on 
 

 
The ache of knowing I was wrong 
 

 
Yet in the mirror youth is sung— 
 

 
A wailing note that will not die, 
 

 
A flicker’s fire in restless bone"
youth,TRUE,figurative,"
I am the wind that bends the city's spine, 
A whisper caught between stone and time. 
Echoes of laughter in the subway's shade, 
Night's shadow steps where hope used to tread. 

Stone steps where dreams once pressed their palms, 
A trembling note that hums beneath the walls. 
Tall voices echo in the hollow street— 
A memory's song, now softened, retreats. 

I drift where the river forgets its name, 
A current cradling both joy and blame. 
Moonlight stitches wounds in silver thread, 
A scar that sings when the world is dead. 

Fading fires glow in a midnight hour, 
Lost shadows dance, then dissolve, then power. 
The clock's hands twist what the heart has said— 
In silent echoes, my past is bled. 

Again I bend the city's restless bone, 
A sigh that finds no home, yet stands alone."
