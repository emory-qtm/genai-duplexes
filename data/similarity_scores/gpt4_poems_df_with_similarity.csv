Wilted histories weigh the air with scars, 
Whispers of loss, still echoing from our blood. 

The echoes of loss rise thick in the blood, 
Each name forgotten, a fading root unbound. 

Each root unbound is tethered to the soil, 
Where borders shift but never heal the pain. 

These shifting borders carve wounds of pain, 
Yet hold the stories of lives we've built anew. 

The stories we've built cradle love made new, 
Even as they weather the storms of erasure. 

We weather storms of erasure, yet we sing, 
Through tongues braided with grief and glory. 

Braided tongues weave grief into fresh glory,
