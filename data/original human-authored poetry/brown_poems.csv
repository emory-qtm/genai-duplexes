Jericho Brown,Duplex (p. 18),"A poem is a gesture toward home.
It makes dark demands I call my own.

     Memory makes demands darker than my own:
     My last love drove a burgundy car. 

My first love drove a burgundy car. 
He was fast and awful, tall as my father.

     Steadfast and awful, my tall father
     Hit hard as a hailstorm. He'd leave marks. 

Light rain hits easy but leaves its own mark
Like the sound of a mother weeping again.

     Like the sound of my mother weeping again,
     No sound beating ends where it began. 

None of the beaten end up how we began. 
A poem is a gesture toward home. ",duplex
Jericho Brown,Duplex (p. 27),"The opposite of rape is understanding
A field of flowers called paintbrushes—

     A field of flowers called paintbrushes,
     Though the spring be less than actual.

Though the spring be less than actual,
Men roam shirtless as if none ever hurt me.

     Men roam that myth. In truth, one hurt me.
     I want to obliterate the flowered field,

To obliterate my need for the field
And raise a building above the grasses,

     A building of prayer against the grasses,
     My body a temple in disrepair.

My body is a temple in disrepair.
The opposite of rape is understanding.",duplex
Jericho Brown,Duplex (p. 49),"I begin with love, hoping to end there.
I don't want to leave a messy corpse.

     I don't want to leave a messy corpse
     Full of medicines that turn in the sun.

Some of my medicines turn in the sun.
Some of us don't need hell to be good.

     Those who need most, need hell to be good.
     What are the symptoms of your sickness?

Here is one symptom of my sickness:
Men who love me are men who miss me.

     Men who leave me are men who miss me
     In the dream where I am an island.

In the dream where I am an island,
I grow green with hope. I'd like to end there.",duplex
Jericho Brown,Duplex (p. 68),"Don't accuse me of sleeping with your man
When I didn't know you had a man.

     Back when I didn't know you had a man,
     The moon glowed above the city's blackout.

I walked home by moonlight through the blackout.
I was too young to be reasonable.

     He was so young, so unreasonable,
     He dipped weed in embalming fluid.

He'd dip our weed in embalming fluid.
We'd make love on trains and in dressing rooms.

     Love in the subway, love in mall restrooms.
     A bore at home, he transformed in the city.

What's yours at home is a wolf in my city.
You can't accuse me of sleeping with a man.",duplex
Jericho Brown,Duplex: Cento (p. 72),"My last love drove a burgundy car,
Color of a rash, a symptom of sickness.

     We were the symptoms, the road our sickness:
     None of our fights ended where they began.

None of the beaten end where they begin.
Any man in love can cause a messy corpse,

     But I didn't want to leave a messy corpse
     Obliterated in some lilied field,

Stench obliterating lilies of the field,
The murderer, young and unreasonable.

     He was so young, so unreasonable,
     Steadfast and awful, tall as my father.

Steadfast and awful, my tall father
Was my first love. He drove a burgundy car.",duplex
