“Where did the handsome beloved go?”,"Where did the handsome beloved go?
I wonder, where did that tall, shapely cypress tree go?

He spread his light among us like a candle.
Where did he go? So strange, where did he go without me?

All day long my heart trembles like a leaf.
All alone at midnight, where did that beloved go?

Go to the road, and ask any passing traveler — 
That soul-stirring companion, where did he go?

Go to the garden, and ask the gardener — 
That tall, shapely rose stem, where did he go?

Go to the rooftop, and ask the watchman — 
That unique sultan, where did he go?

Like a madman, I search in the meadows!
That deer in the meadows, where did he go?

My tearful eyes overflow like a river — 
That pearl in the vast sea, where did he go?

All night long, I implore both moon and Venus — 
That lovely face, like a moon, where did he go?

If he is mine, why is he with others?
Since he’s not here, to what “there” did he go?

If his heart and soul are joined with God,
And he left this realm of earth and water, where did he go?

Tell me clearly, Shams of Tabriz,
Of whom it is said, “The sun never dies” — where did he go?

Sonnet 131 [I’d sing of Love in such a novel fashion],"I’d sing of Love in such a novel fashion
that from her cruel side I would draw by force
a thousand sighs a day, kindling again
in her cold mind a thousand high desires;

I’d see her lovely face transform quite often
her eyes grow wet and more compassionate,
like one who feels regret, when it’s too late,
for causing someone’s suffering by mistake;

And I’d see scarlet roses in the snows,
tossed by the breeze, discover ivory
that turns to marble those who see it near them;

All this I’d do because I do not mind 
my discontentment in this one short life,
but glory rather in my later fame.",Petrarch,sonnet
"Sonnet 102 [If no love is, O God, what fele I so?] ","If no love is, O God, what fele I so?
    And if love is, what thing and which is he?
    If love be good, from whennes cometh my woo?
    If it be wikke, a wonder thynketh me,
    When every torment and adversite
    That cometh of hym, may to me savory thinke,
    For ay thurst I, the more that ich it drynke.

Sonnet 101 [Ways apt and new to sing of love I’d find],"Ways apt and new to sing of love I’d find,
Forcing from her hard heart full many a sigh,
And re-enkindle in her frozen mind
Desires a thousand, passionate and high;
O’er her fair face would see each swift change pass,
See her fond eyes at length where pity reigns,
As one who sorrows when too late, alas!
For his own error and another’s pains;
See the fresh roses edging that fair snow
Move with her breath, that ivory descried,
Which turns to marble him who sees it near;
See all, for which in this brief life below
Myself I weary not but rather pride
That Heaven for later times has kept me here.",Petrarch,sonnet
"Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind ","Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,
But as for me, hélas, I may no more.
The vain travail hath wearied me so sore,
I am of them that farthest cometh behind.
Yet may I by no means my wearied mind
Draw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore
Fainting I follow. I leave off therefore,
Sithens in a net I seek to hold the wind.
Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,
As well as I may spend his time in vain.
And graven with diamonds in letters plain
There is written, her fair neck round about:
Noli me tangere, for Caesar’s I am,
And wild for to hold, though I seem tame.",Thomas Wyatt,sonnet
Avising the Bright Beams,"Avising the bright beams of these fair eyes
Where he is that mine oft moisteth and washeth,
The wearied mind straight from the heart departeth
For to rest in his worldly paradise
And find the sweet bitter under this guise.
What webs he hath wrought well he perceiveth
Whereby with himself on love he plaineth
That spurreth with fire and bridleth with ice.
Thus is it in such extremity brought,
In frozen thought, now and now it standeth in flame.
Twixt misery and wealth, twixt earnest and game,
But few glad, and many diverse thought
With sore repentance of his hardiness.
Of such a root cometh fruit fruitless.",Sir Thomas Wyatt,sonnet
Farewell Love and all thy Laws for ever,"Farewell love and all thy laws forever;
Thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more.
Senec and Plato call me from thy lore
To perfect wealth, my wit for to endeavour.
In blind error when I did persever,
Thy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore,
Hath taught me to set in trifles no store
And scape forth, since liberty is lever.
Therefore farewell; go trouble younger hearts
And in me claim no more authority.
With idle youth go use thy property
And thereon spend thy many brittle darts,
For hitherto though I have lost all my time,
Me lusteth no lenger rotten boughs to climb.",Sir Thomas Wyatt,sonnet
I Find no Peace,"I find no peace, and all my war is done.
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.
I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;
And nought I have, and all the world I seize on.
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison
And holdeth me not—yet can I scape no wise—
Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.
I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.
I love another, and thus I hate myself.
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;
Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,
And my delight is causer of this strife.",Sir Thomas Wyatt,sonnet
The Long Love that in my Thought doth Harbour,"The longë love that in my thought doth harbour 
And in mine hert doth keep his residence, 
Into my face presseth with bold pretence 
And therein campeth, spreading his banner. 
She that me learneth to love and suffer 
And will that my trust and lustës negligence 
Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence, 
With his hardiness taketh displeasure. 
Wherewithall unto the hert's forest he fleeth, 
Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry, 
And there him hideth and not appeareth. 
What may I do when my master feareth 
But in the field with him to live and die? 
For good is the life ending faithfully.",Sir Thomas Wyatt,sonnet
"My Galley, Charged with Forgetfulness","My galley, chargèd with forgetfulness,
Thorough sharp seas in winter nights doth pass
'Tween rock and rock; and eke mine en'my, alas,
That is my lord, steereth with cruelness;
And every owre a thought in readiness,
As though that death were light in such a case.
An endless wind doth tear the sail apace
Of forced sighs and trusty fearfulness.
A rain of tears, a cloud of dark disdain,
Hath done the weared cords great hinderance;
Wreathèd with error and eke with ignorance.
The stars be hid that led me to this pain;
Drownèd is Reason that should me comfort,
And I remain despairing of the port.",Sir Thomas Wyatt,sonnet
Unstable Dream,"Unstable dream, according to the place,
Be steadfast once, or else at least be true.
By tasted sweetness make me not to rue
The sudden loss of thy false feignèd grace.
By good respect in such a dangerous case
Thou broughtest not her into this tossing mew
But madest my sprite live, my care to renew,
My body in tempest her succour to embrace.
The body dead, the sprite had his desire,
Painless was th'one, th'other in delight.
Why then, alas, did it not keep it right,
Returning, to leap into the fire?
     And where it was at wish, it could not remain,
     Such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain.",Sir Thomas Wyatt,sonnet
Stand Whoso List,"Stand whoso list upon the slipper top 
   Of court’s estates, and let me here rejoice; 
And use me quiet without let or stop, 
   Unknown in court, that hath such brackish joys: 
      In hidden place, so let my days forth pass, 
   That when my years be done, withouten noise, 
      I may die agèd after the common trace, 
For him death gripeth right hard by the crope 
   That is much known of other; and of himself alas, 
   Doth die unknown, dazed with dreadful face.",Sir Thomas Wyatt,sonnet
I Abide and Abide and Better Abide,"I abide and abide and better abide, 
And after the old proverb, the happy day; 
And ever my lady to me doth say, 
""Let me alone and I will provide."" 
I abide and abide and tarry the tide, 
And with abiding speed well ye may. 
Thus do I abide I wot alway, 
Nother obtaining nor yet denied. 
Ay me! this long abiding 
Seemeth to me, as who sayeth, 
A prolonging of a dying death, 
Or a refusing of a desir'd thing. 
Much were it better for to be plain 
Than to say ""abide"" and yet shall not obtain.",Sir Thomas Wyatt,sonnet
Amoretti III: The Sovereign Beauty,"The sovereign beauty which I do admire,
Witness the world how worthy to be praised:
The light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire
In my frail spirit, by her from baseness raised;
That being now with her huge brightness dazed,
Base thing I can no more endure to view;
But looking still on her, I stand amazed
At wondrous sight of so celestial hue.
So when my tongue would speak her praises due,
It stopped is with thought's astonishment:
And when my pen would write her titles true,
It ravish'd is with fancy's wonderment:
Yet in my heart I then both speak and write
The wonder that my wit cannot endite.",Edmund Spenser,sonnet
Amoretti XXII: This Holy Season,"This holy season, fit to fast and pray,
Men to devotion ought to be inclin'd:
Therefore I likewise on so holy day,
For my sweet saint some service fit will find.
Her temple fair is built within my mind,
In which her glorious image placed is,
On which my thoughts do day and night attend,
Like sacred priests that never think amiss.
There I to her as th' author of my bliss,
Will build an altar to appease her ire:
And on the same my heart will sacrifice,
Burning in flames of pure and chaste desire:
The which vouchsafe, O goddess, to accept,
Amongst thy dearest relics to be kept.",Edmund Spenser,sonnet
Amoretti LXVII: Like as a Huntsman,"Like as a huntsman after weary chase,
Seeing the game from him escap'd away,
Sits down to rest him in some shady place,
With panting hounds beguiled of their prey:
So after long pursuit and vain assay,
When I all weary had the chase forsook,
The gentle deer return'd the self-same way,
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.
There she beholding me with milder look,
Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:
Till I in hand her yet half trembling took,
And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.
Strange thing, me seem'd, to see a beast so wild,
So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd.",Edmund Spenser,sonnet
Amoretti LXVIII: Most Glorious Lord of Life,"Most glorious Lord of life, that on this day,
Didst make thy triumph over death and sin:
And having harrow'd hell, didst bring away
Captivity thence captive, us to win:
This joyous day, dear Lord, with joy begin,
And grant that we for whom thou diddest die,
Being with thy dear blood clean wash'd from sin,
May live for ever in felicity.
And that thy love we weighing worthily,
May likewise love thee for the same again:
And for thy sake, that all like dear didst buy,
With love may one another entertain.
So let us love, dear love, like as we ought,
Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.",Edmund Spenser,sonnet
Amoretti LXXIV: Most Happy Letters,"Most happy letters, fram'd by skilful trade,
With which that happy name was first design'd:
The which three times thrice happy hath me made,
With gifts of body, fortune, and of mind.
The first my being to me gave by kind,
From mother's womb deriv'd by due descent,
The second is my sovereign Queen most kind,
That honour and large richesse to me lent.
The third my love, my life's last ornament,
By whom my spirit out of dust was raised:
To speak her praise and glory excellent,
Of all alive most worthy to be praised.
Ye three Elizabeths for ever live,
That three such graces did unto me give.",Edmund Spenser,sonnet
Amoretti LXXV: One Day I Wrote her Name,"One day I wrote her name upon the strand,
But came the waves and washed it away:
Again I wrote it with a second hand,
But came the tide, and made my pains his prey.
""Vain man,"" said she, ""that dost in vain assay,
A mortal thing so to immortalize;
For I myself shall like to this decay,
And eke my name be wiped out likewise.""
""Not so,"" (quod I) ""let baser things devise
To die in dust, but you shall live by fame:
My verse your vertues rare shall eternize,
And in the heavens write your glorious name:
Where whenas death shall all the world subdue,
Our love shall live, and later life renew.""",Edmund Spenser,sonnet
Amoretti LXXIX: Men Call you Fair,"Men call you fair, and you do credit it,
For that your self ye daily such do see:
But the true fair, that is the gentle wit,
And vertuous mind, is much more prais'd of me.
For all the rest, how ever fair it be,
Shall turn to naught and lose that glorious hue:
But only that is permanent and free
From frail corruption, that doth flesh ensue.
That is true beauty: that doth argue you
To be divine, and born of heavenly seed:
Deriv'd from that fair Spirit, from whom all true
And perfect beauty did at first proceed.
He only fair, and what he fair hath made,
All other fair, like flowers untimely fade.",Edmund Spenser,sonnet
"Astrophil and Stella 1: Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show","Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show, 
That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,— 
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know, 
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,— 
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe; 
Studying inventions fine her wits to entertain, 
Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow 
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburn'd brain. 
But words came halting forth, wanting invention's stay; 
Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows; 
And others' feet still seem'd but strangers in my way. 
Thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes, 
Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite, 
""Fool,"" said my Muse to me, ""look in thy heart, and write.""",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
Astrophil and Stella 3: Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine,"Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine, 
That, bravely mask'd, their fancies may be told; 
Or, Pindar's apes, flaunt they in phrases fine, 
Enam'ling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold. 
Or else let them in statelier glory shine, 
Ennobling newfound tropes with problems old; 
Or with strange similes enrich each line, 
Of herbs or beasts which Ind or Afric hold. 
For me, in sooth, no Muse but one I know; 
Phrases and problems from my reach do grow, 
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites. 
How then? even thus: in Stella's face I read 
What love and beauty be; then all my deed 
But copying is, what in her Nature writes.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
"Astrophil and Stella 7: When Nature made her chief work, Stella's eyes","When Nature made her chief work, Stella's eyes, 
In colour black why wrapt she beams so bright? 
Would she in beamy black, like painter wise, 
Frame daintiest lustre, mix'd of shades and light? 
Or did she else that sober hue devise, 
In object best to knit and strength our sight; 
Lest, if no veil these brave gleams did disguise, 
They, sunlike, should more dazzle than delight? 
Or would she her miraculous power show, 
That, whereas black seems beauty's contrary, 
She even in black doth make all beauties flow? 
Both so, and thus, she, minding Love should be 
Plac'd ever there, gave him this mourning weed 
To honour all their deaths who for her bleed.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
Astrophil and Stella 15: You that do search for every purling spring ,"You that do search for every purling spring 
Which from the ribs of old Parnassus flows, 
And every flower, not sweet perhaps, which grows 
Near thereabouts, into your poesy wring; 
Ye that do dictionary's method bring 
Into your rimes, running in rattling rows; 
You that poor Petrarch's long-deceased woes 
With new-born sighs and denizen'd wit do sing: 
You take wrong ways; those far-fet helps be such 
As do bewray a want of inward touch, 
And sure, at length stol'n goods do come to light. 
But if, both for your love and skill, your name 
You seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Fame, 
Stella behold, and then begin to endite.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
"Astrophil and Stella 20: Fly, fly, my friends, I have my death wound, fly","Fly, fly, my friends, I have my death wound, fly! 
See there that boy, that murd'ring boy, I say, 
Who, like a thief, hid in dark bush doth lie 
Till bloody bullet get him wrongful prey. 
So tyrant he no fitter place could spy, 
Nor so fair level in so secret stay, 
As that sweet black which veils the heav'nly eye; 
There himself with his shot he close doth lay. 
Poor passenger, pass now thereby I did, 
And stay'd, pleas'd with the prospect of the place, 
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid; 
But straight I saw motions of lightning grace 
And then descried the glist'ring of his dart: 
But ere I could fly thence it pierc'd my heart.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
"Astrophil and Stella 23: The curious wits, seeing dull pensiveness","The curious wits, seeing dull pensiveness 
Bewray itself in my long-settl'd eyes, 
Whence those same fumes of melancholy rise, 
With idle pains and missing aim do guess. 
Some, that know how my spring I did address, 
Deem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge plies; 
Others, because the prince my service tries, 
Think that I think state errors to redress; 
But harder judges judge ambition's ragei 
Scourge of itself, still climbing slipp'ry placei 
Holds my young brain captiv'd in golden cage. 
O fool or over-wise! alas, the race 
Of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start 
But only Stella's eyes and Stella's heart.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
"Astrophil and Stella 31: With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies","With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies! 
How silently, and with how wan a face! 
What, may it be that even in heav'nly place 
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries! 
Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes 
Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case, 
I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace 
To me, that feel the like, thy state descries. 
Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me, 
Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit? 
Are beauties there as proud as here they be? 
Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet 
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess? 
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
"Astrophil and Stella 33: I might!—unhappy word—O me, I might","I might!—unhappy word—O me, I might, 
And then would not, or could not, see my bliss; 
Till now wrapt in a most infernal night, 
I find how heav'nly day, wretch! I did miss. 
Heart, rend thyself, thou dost thyself but right; 
No lovely Paris made thy Helen his, 
No force, no fraud robb'd thee of thy delight, 
Nor Fortune of thy fortune author is; 
But to myself myself did give the blow, 
While too much wit, forsooth, so troubled me 
That I respects for both our sakes must show: 
And yet could not by rising morn foresee 
How fair a day was near: O punish'd eyes, 
That I had been more foolish,—or more wise!",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
"Astrophil and Stella 39: Come Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace","Come Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace, 
The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe, 
The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release, 
Th' indifferent judge between the high and low. 
With shield of proof shield me from out the prease 
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw: 
O make in me those civil wars to cease; 
I will good tribute pay, if thou do so. 
Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed, 
A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light, 
A rosy garland and a weary head: 
And if these things, as being thine by right, 
Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me, 
Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
"Astrophil and Stella 41: Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance ","Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance 
Guided so well that I obtain'd the prize, 
Both by the judgment of the English eyes 
And of some sent from that sweet enemy France; 
Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance, 
Town folks my strength; a daintier judge applies 
His praise to sleight which from good use doth rise; 
Some lucky wits impute it but to chance; 
Others, because of both sides I do take 
My blood from them who did excel in this, 
Think Nature me a man of arms did make. 
How far they shot awry! The true cause is, 
Stella look'd on, and from her heav'nly face 
Sent forth the beams which made so fair my race.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
"Astrophil and Stella 64: No more, my dear, no more these counsels try","No more, my dear, no more these counsels try; 
Oh, give my passions leave to run their race; 
Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace; 
Let folk o'ercharg'd with brain against me cry; 
Let clouds bedim my face, break in mine eye; 
Let me no steps but of lost labour trace; 
Let all the earth with scorn recount my case, 
But do not will me from my love to fly. 
I do not envy Aristotle's wit, 
Nor do aspire to Caesar's bleeding fame; 
Nor aught do care though some above me sit; 
Nor hope nor wish another course to frame, 
But that which once may win thy cruel heart: 
Thou art my wit, and thou my virtue art.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
Astrophil and Stella 71: Who will in fairest book of nature know ,"Who will in fairest book of nature know 
How virtue may best lodg'd in beauty be, 
Let him but learn of love to read in thee, 
Stella, those fair lines which true goodness show. 
There shall he find all vices' overthrow, 
Not by rude force, but sweetest sovereignty 
Of reason, from whose light those night-birds fly; 
That inward sun in thine eyes shineth so. 
And, not content to be perfection's heir 
Thyself, dost strive all minds that way to move, 
Who mark in thee what is in thee most fair. 
So while thy beauty draws thy heart to love, 
As fast thy virtue bends that love to good: 
But ""Ah,"" Desire still cries, ""Give me some food!""",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet

"Astrophil and Stella 92: Be your words made, good sir, of Indian ware","Be your words made, good sir, of Indian ware, 
That you allow me them by so small rate? 
Or do you cutted Spartans imitate? 
Or do you mean my tender ears to spare, 
That to my questions you so total are? 
When I demand of Phoenix Stella's state, 
You say, forsooth, you left her well of late: 
O God, think you that satisfies my care? 
I would know whether she did sit or walk; 
How cloth'd, how waited on; sigh'd she, or smil'd; 
Whereof, with whom, how often did she talk; 
With what pastime time's journey she beguiled; 
If her lips deign'd to sweeten my poor name. 
Say all; and all well said, still say the same.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet

Song from Arcadia: “My True Love Hath My Heart”,"My true-love hath my heart and I have his,
By just exchange one for the other given:
I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;
There never was a bargain better driven.
His heart in me keeps me and him in one;
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:
He loves my heart, for once it was his own;
I cherish his because in me it bides.
His heart his wound received from my sight;
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;
For as from me on him his hurt did light,
So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart:
Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss,
My true love hath my heart and I have his.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet
"""Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust""","Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust;

Draw in thy beams and humble all thy might

Which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light,
That doth both shine and give us sight to see.
O take fast hold; let that light be thy guide

And think how evil becometh him to slide,
Who seeketh heav'n, and comes of heav'nly breath.
Then farewell, world; thy uttermost I see:
Eternal Love, maintain thy life in me.",Sir Philip Sidney,sonnet

I, with whose eyes her eyes committed theft, 
    I, who did make her blush when I was named: 
         Must I lose ring, flowers, blush, theft, and go naked, 
         Watching with sighs till dead love be awaked? 
 
I, that, when drowsy Argus fell asleep, 
    Like jealousy o’erwatched with desire, 
Was even warned modesty to keep, 
    While her breath, speaking, kindled Nature’s fire: 
         Must I look on a-cold, while others warm them? 
         Do Vulcan’s brothers in such fine nets arm them? 
 
Was it for this that I might Myra see 
    Washing the water with her beauties white? 
Yet would she never write her love to me. 
    Thinks wit of change, while thoughts are in delight? 
         Mad girls must safely love as they may leave; 
         No man can print a kiss: lines may deceive.",Baron Brooke Fulke Greville,sonnet
"A Coronet for his Mistress, Philosophy","Muses that sing love's sensual empery,
And lovers kindling your enraged fires
At Cupid's bonfires burning in the eye,
Blown with the empty breath of vain desires;
You that prefer the painted cabinet
Before the wealthy jewels it doth store ye,
That all your joys in dying figures set,
And stain the living substance of your glory;
Abjure those joys, abhor their memory,
And let my love the honour'd subject be
Of love, and honour's complete history.

        Make lute and lyre his loved fame express;

 Him organ’s breath, that winds or waters lend.

Where nightingales in Arden sit and sing
Amongst the dainty dew-impearled flowers;

Of liveless clods, us living men to make, 
He did bestow in temper of the mind. 
But you broke into heaven’s immortal store, 
Where virtue, honor, wit, and beauty lay;

Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.

Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west,

To say they err I dare not be so bold,
Although I swear it to myself alone.
And, to be sure that is not false I swear,
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
One on another’s neck, do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgement’s place.
    In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,

The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,
At the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand!
To be so tickled, they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips,
O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
Making dead wood more blest than living lips.

For since each hand hath put on nature’s power,
Fairing the foul with art’s false borrow’d face,
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
But it profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
Therefore my mistress’ brows are raven black,
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
Slandering creation with a false esteem:

Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,
For compounded sweet forgoing simple savour,
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,

It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
Under the blow of thrilled discontent,

Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
In the distraction of his madding fever!

Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.

Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
The earth can yield me but a common grave,
When you entombed in men’s eyes shall lie.
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
Which eyes not yet created shall o’er-read,

To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
My saucy bark inferior far to his
On your broad main doth willfully appear.
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;

I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of and pays it thee again.
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give
And found it in thy cheek; he can afford
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.

And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
Have added feathers to the learned’s wing
And given grace a double majesty.
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,

The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
Thou by thy dial’s shady stealth mayst know
Time’s thievish progress to eternity.
Look, what thy memory can not contain
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
Those children nursed, deliver’d from thy brain,
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.

Why is my verse so barren of new pride (Sonnet 76),"Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
So far from variation or quick change?
Why with the time do I not glance aside

Why write I still all one, ever the same,
And keep invention in a noted weed,
That every word doth almost tell my name,
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?
O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,
And you and love are still my argument;

Spending again what is already spent:

Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
Now counting best to be with you alone,
Then better’d that the world may see my pleasure;
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
And by and by clean starved for a look;

The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
So then thou has but lost the dregs of life,
The prey of worms, my body being dead,
The coward conquest of a wretch’s knife,

Thy worth the greater, being woo’d of time;
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
And hour present’st a pure unstained prime.

By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.

Before the golden tresses of the dead,
The right of sepulchers, were shorn away,
To live a second life on second head;
Ere beauty’s dead fleece made another gay:

And lace itself with his society?

And steel dead seeing of his living hue?
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
Beggar’d of blood to blush through lively veins?

And though they be outstipp’d by every pen,
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
Exceeded by the height of happier men.
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
‘Had my friend’s Muse grown with this growing age,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
To march in ranks of better equipage:
    But since he died and poets better prove,
    Theirs for their style I’ll read, his for his love.’",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts (Sonnet 31),"Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
And there reigns love and all love’s loving parts,
And all those friends which I thought buried.
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Hath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye
As interest of the dead, which now appear
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;
That due of many now is thine alone:
    Their images I loved I view in thee,
    And thou, all they, has all the all of me.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
How can I then return in happy plight (Sonnet 28),"How can I then return in happy plight,

But day by night, and night by day, oppress’d?
And each, though enemies to either’s reign,
Do in consent shake hands to torture me;
The one by toil, the other to complain
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
I tell the day, to please him thou art bright
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
So flatter I the swart-complexion’d night,
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild’st the even
     But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
     And night doth nightly make grief’s strength seem stronger.",William Shakespeare,sonnet

To work my mind, when body’s work’s expired:
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
Save that my soul’s imaginary sight
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.
    Lo! Thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
    For thee and for myself no quiet find.",William Shakespeare,sonnet

Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
In thy soul’s thought, all naked, will bestow it;
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving 
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
And puts apparel on my tatter’d loving,
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
    Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.",William Shakespeare,sonnet

For through the painter must you see his skill,
To find where your true image pictured lies;
Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thing for me
Are windows to my breast where-through the sun
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;

And in mine own loves’s strength seem to decay,
O’ercharged with burden of mine one love’s might.

Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
How can I then be elder than thou art?
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.

Making a couplement of proud compare,
With sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems,
With April’s first-born flowers, and all things rare

And do whate’er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
O, carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow,

Such heavenly touches ne’er touch’d earthly faces.’

With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?

And many maiden gardens yet unset
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
So should the lines of life that life repair,
Which this, Time’s pencil, or my pupil pen,
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.

Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
Then of thy beauty do I question make,
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others growl

Without this, folly, age and cold decay:

For thou art so possess’d with murderous hate
That ’gainst thyself thou stick’st not to conspire,
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate

By children’s eyes her husband’s shape in mind.

In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.

Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,’
Proving his beauty by succession thine!

Increasing store with loss and loss with store;

                        Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

When all aloud the wind doth blow
   And coughing drowns the parson's saw
And birds sit brooding in the snow
   And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,
                        Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind; (Sonnet 113) ","Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function and is partly blind,
Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
For it no form delivers to the heart
Of bird, of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;
For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,
The most sweet favour or deformed’st creature,
The mountain or the sea, the day or night,
The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:
    Incapable of more, replete with you,
    My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 15: When I consider everything that grows,"When I consider everything that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
And wear their brave state out of memory;
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night;
And all in war with Time for love of you,
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?,"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Sonnet 19: Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws","Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
And burn the long-liv'd Phoenix in her blood;
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
But I forbid thee one more heinous crime:
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen!
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
Yet do thy worst, old Time! Despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 25: Let those who are in favour with their stars,"Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast,
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
For at a frown they in their glory die.
The painful warrior famoused for fight,
After a thousand victories once foil'd,
Is from the book of honour razed quite,
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
Then happy I, that love and am beloved
Where I may not remove nor be removed.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Sonnet 29: When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes","When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself and curse my fate,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
(Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate;
       For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
       That then I scorn to change my state with kings.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 30: When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
And moan th' expense of many a vanish'd sight;
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Which I new pay as if not paid before.
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 32: If thou survive my well-contented day,"If thou survive my well-contented day,
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
Compare them with the bettering of the time,
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
Exceeded by the height of happier men.
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
""Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
To march in ranks of better equipage:
But since he died and poets better prove,
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.""",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 33: Full many a glorious morning have I seen,"Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace.
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With all-triumphant splendour on my brow;
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Sonnet 53: What is your substance, whereof are you made","What is your substance, whereof are you made,
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,
And you, but one, can every shadow lend.
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you;
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
And you in Grecian tires are painted new.
Speak of the spring and foison of the year:
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
The other as your bounty doth appear;
And you in every blessèd shape we know.
    In all external grace you have some part,
    But you like none, none you, for constant heart.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 60: Like as the waves make towards the pebbl'd shore,"Like as the waves make towards the pebbl'd shore,
So do our minutes hasten to their end;
Each changing place with that which goes before,
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
Nativity, once in the main of light,
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,
Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 64: When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd,"When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
When I have seen such interchange of state,
Or state itself confounded to decay;
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
That Time will come and take my love away.
This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Sonnet 66: Tir'd with all these, for restful death I cry","Tir'd with all these, for restful death I cry,
As, to behold desert a beggar born,
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
And strength by limping sway disabled,
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
And captive good attending captain ill.
Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 71: No longer mourn for me when I am dead,"No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell; 
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
The hand that writ it; for I love you so, 
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, 
If thinking on me then should make you woe.
O, if (I say) you look upon this verse, 
When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,
But let your love even with my life decay,
Lest the wise world should look into your moan, 
And mock you with me after I am gone.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 73: That time of year thou mayst in me behold,"That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west,
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the death-bed whereon it must expire,
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 94: They that have power to hurt and will do none,"They that have power to hurt and will do none,
That do not do the thing they most do show,
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
And husband nature's riches from expense;
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others but stewards of their excellence.
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet
Though to itself it only live and die,
But if that flower with base infection meet,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 97: How like a winter hath my absence been,"How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
What old December's bareness everywhere!
And yet this time remov'd was summer's time,
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
Bearing the wanton burthen of the prime,
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
And thou away, the very birds are mute;
Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 106: When in the chronicle of wasted time,"When in the chronicle of wasted time 
I see descriptions of the fairest wights, 
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme 
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, 
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, 
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, 
I see their antique pen would have express'd 
Even such a beauty as you master now. 
So all their praises are but prophecies 
Of this our time, all you prefiguring; 
And, for they look'd but with divining eyes, 
They had not skill enough your worth to sing: 
For we, which now behold these present days, 
Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Sonnet 107: Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul","Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul 
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come, 
Can yet the lease of my true love control, 
Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom. 
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd 
And the sad augurs mock their own presage; 
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd 
And peace proclaims olives of endless age. 
Now with the drops of this most balmy time 
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes, 
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme, 
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes; 
And thou in this shalt find thy monument, 
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Sonnet 110: Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there","Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there 
And made myself a motley to the view, 
Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, 
Made old offences of affections new. 
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth 
Askance and strangely: but, by all above, 
These blenches gave my heart another youth, 
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love. 
Now all is done, have what shall have no end! 
Mine appetite, I never more will grind 
On newer proof, to try an older friend, 
A god in love, to whom I am confin'd. 
Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, 
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Sonnet 111: O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,","O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide, 
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, 
That did not better for my life provide 
Than public means which public manners breeds. 
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand, 
And almost thence my nature is subdu'd 
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand. 
Pity me then and wish I were renew'd; 
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink 
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection; 
No bitterness that I will bitter think, 
Nor double penance, to correct correction. 
Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye 
Even that your pity is enough to cure me.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 129: Th'expense of spirit in a waste of shame,"Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame 
Is lust in action; and till action, lust 
Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame, 
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust, 
Enjoyed no sooner but despisèd straight, 
Past reason hunted; and, no sooner had 
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait 
On purpose laid to make the taker mad; 
Mad in pursuit and in possession so, 
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme; 
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe; 
Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream. 
    All this the world well knows; yet none knows well 
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 130: My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.
   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
   As any she belied with false compare.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Sonnet 146: Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,","Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth, 
[......] these rebel powers that thee array, 
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth, 
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay? 
Why so large cost, having so short a lease, 
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? 
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess, 
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end? 
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss 
And let that pine to aggravate thy store; 
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross; 
Within be fed, without be rich no more. 
So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men, 
And, Death once dead, there's no more dying then.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 55: Not marble nor the gilded monuments,"Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
And broils root out the work of masonry,
Nor Mars his sword nor war’s quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory.
’Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom.
    So, till the Judgement that yourself arise,
    You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 1: From fairest creatures we desire increase,"From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory;
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding.
   Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
   To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Sonnet 123: No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change","No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
They are but dressings of a former sight.
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told.
Thy registers and thee I both defy,
Not wondering at the present nor the past;
For thy records and what we see doth lie,
Made more or less by that continual haste.
   This I do vow, and this shall ever be:
   I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 121: 'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,"’Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
When not to be receives reproach of being, 
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing.
For why should others’ false adulterate eyes
Give salutation to my sportive blood?
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies, 
Which in their wills count bad that I think good?
No, I am that I am; and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own:
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown, 
    Unless this general evil they maintain:
    All men are bad and in their badness reign.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
Sonnet 133: Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan,"Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me:
Is’t not enough to torture me alone,
But slave to slavery my sweet’st friend must be?
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed;
Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken,
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed. 
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward, 
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
Whoe’er keeps me, let my heart be his guard:
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail.
    And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee, 
    Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.",William Shakespeare,sonnet
"Sonnet 139: O, call not me to justify the wrong","O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Use power with power, and slay me not by art.
Tell me thou lov’st elsewhere; but in my sight, 
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside;
What need’st thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my o’erpressed defense can bide?
Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries—
    Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
    Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.",William Shakespeare,sonnet

Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine, 
Robbed others’ beds’ revenues of their rents.
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov’st those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows, 
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.

For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Th’ uncertain sickly appetite to please.
My reason, the physician to my love,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept, 
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
Desire is death, which physic did except.
Past cure I am, now reason is past care, 
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;

At random from the truth vainly expressed:

Pour new seas in mine eyes, that so I might
Drown my world with my weeping earnestly,

What is it worth that Wisdom does not scorn?
   The blasts of Sickness, Care, and Grief appal,
   That laid the Friends in dust, whose natal morn
Rose near their own;—and solemn is the call;—
   Yet, like those weak, deserted leaves forlorn,
   Shivering they cling to life, and fear to fall!",Anna Seward,sonnet
Sonnet XLIV,"written in the churchyard at Middleton in Sussex

Press’d by the Moon, mute arbitress of tides, 
    While the loud equinox its pow’r combines, 
    The sea no more its swelling surge confines, 
But o’er the shrinking land sublimely rides. 
The wild blasts, rising from the Western cave, 
    Drives the huge billows from their heaving bed; 
    Tears from their grassy tombs the village dead, 
And breaks the silent sabbath of the grave! 
With shells and seaweed mingled, on the shore, 
    Lo! their bones whiten in the frequent wave; 
    But vain to them the winds and waters rave; 
They hear the warring elements no more: 
While I am doom’d—by life’s long storm opprest, 
To gaze with envy, on their gloomy rest.",Charlotte Smith,sonnet
Sonnet XCI [I can in groups these mimic flowers compose],"Reflections on Some Drawings of Plants

I can in groups these mimic flowers compose,
  These bells and golden eyes, embathed in dew; 
Catch the soft blush that warms the early Rose, 
  Or the pale Iris cloud with veins of blue; 
Copy the scallop’d leaves, and downy stems, 
  And bid the pencil’s varied shades arrest 
Spring’s humid buds, and Summer’s musky gems: 
  But, save the portrait on my bleeding breast, 
I have no semblance of that form adored, 
  That form, expressive of a soul divine, 
  So early blighted, and while life is mine, 
With fond regret, and ceaseless grief deplored— 
  That grief, my angel! with too faithful art 
  Enshrines thy image in thy Mother’s heart. ",Charlotte Smith,sonnet
"Sonnet: On Being Cautioned Against Walking on an Headland Overlooking the Sea, Because It Was Frequented by a Lunatic","Is there a solitary wretch who hies 
   To the tall cliff, with starting pace or slow, 
And, measuring, views with wild and hollow eyes 
   Its distance from the waves that chide below; 
Who, as the sea-born gale with frequent sighs 
   Chills his cold bed upon the mountain turf, 
With hoarse, half-uttered lamentation, lies 
   Murmuring responses to the dashing surf? 
In moody sadness, on the giddy brink, 
   I see him more with envy than with fear; 
He has no nice felicities that shrink 
   From giant horrors; wildly wandering here, 
He seems (uncursed with reason) not to know 
The depth or the duration of his woe.",Charlotte Smith,sonnet
To the Shade of Burns,"Mute is thy wild harp, now, O Bard sublime! 
   Who, amid Scotia’s mountain solitude, 
Great Nature taught to “build the lofty rhyme,” 
   And even beneath the daily pressure, rude, 
Of laboring Poverty, thy generous blood, 
Fired with the love of freedom—Not subdued 
   Wert thou by thy low fortune: But a time 
   Like this we live in, when the abject chime 
Of echoing Parasite is best approved, 
   Was not for thee—Indignantly is fled 
Thy noble Spirit; and no longer moved 
   By all the ills o’er which thine heart has bled, 
   Associate worthy of the illustrious dead, 
Enjoys with them “the Liberty it loved.”",Charlotte Smith,sonnet
On the Departure of the Nightingale,"Sweet poet of the woods, a long adieu! 
   Farewell soft mistrel of the early year! 
Ah! ’twill be long ere thou shalt sing anew, 
   And pour thy music on the night’s dull ear. 
Whether on spring thy wandering flights await, 
   Or whether silent in our groves you dwell, 
The pensive muse shall own thee for her mate, 
   And still protect the song she loves so well. 
With cautious step the love-lorn youth shall glide 
   Through the lone brake that shades thy mossy nest; 
And shepherd girls from eyes profane shall hide 
   The gentle bird who sings of pity best: 
For still thy voice shall soft affections move, 
And still be dear to sorrow and to love!",Charlotte Smith,sonnet
Bereavement,"Whose was that gentle voice, that, whispering sweet, 
      Promised methought long days of bliss sincere! 
      Soothing it stole on my deluded ear, 
Most like soft music, that might sometimes cheat 
Thoughts dark and drooping! ’Twas the voice of Hope. 
      Of love and social scenes, it seemed to speak, 
      Of truth, of friendship, of affection meek; 
That, oh! poor friend, might to life’s downward slope 
Lead us in peace, and bless our latest hours. 
      Ah me! the prospect saddened as she sung; 
      Loud on my startled ear the death-bell rung; 
Chill darkness wrapt the pleasurable bowers, 
Whilst Horror, pointing to yon breathless clay, 
“No peace be thine,” exclaimed, “away, away!”",William Lisle Bowles,sonnet
Evening,"Evening! as slow thy placid shades descend, 
      Veiling with gentlest hush the landscape still, 
      The lonely battlement, the farthest hill 
And wood, I think of those who have no friend; 
Who now, perhaps, by melancholy led, 
      From the broad blaze of day, where pleasure flaunts, 
      Retiring, wander to the ring-dove’s haunts 
Unseen; and watch the tints that o’er thy bed 
Hang lovely; oft to musing Fancy’s eye 
      Presenting fairy vales, where the tir’d mind 
      Might rest beyond the murmurs of mankind, 
Nor hear the hourly moans of misery! 
Alas for man! that Hope’s fair views the while 
Should smile like you, and perish as they smile!",William Lisle Bowles,sonnet
On Education,"December 1789

When infant Reason first exerts her sway,
And new-formed thoughts their earliest charms display;
Then let the growing race employ your care
Then guard their opening minds from Folly’s snare;
Correct the rising passions of their youth,
Teach them each serious, each important truth;
Plant heavenly virtue in the tender breast,
Destroy each vice that might its growth molest;
Point out betimes the course they should pursue;
Then with redoubled pleasure shall you view
Their reason strengthen as their years increase,
Their virtue ripen and their follies cease;
Like corn sown early in the fertile soil,
The richest harvest shall repay your toil.",Elizabeth Bentley,sonnet
"Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802 ","Earth has not anything to show more fair:
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
A sight so touching in its majesty:
This City now doth, like a garment, wear
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
Never did sun more beautifully steep
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
The river glideth at his own sweet will:
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
And all that mighty heart is lying still!",William Wordsworth,sonnet
It is not to be Thought of,"It is not to be thought of that the Flood
Of British freedom, which, to the open sea
Of the world's praise, from dark antiquity
Hath flowed, ""with pomp of waters, unwithstood,""
Roused though it be full often to a mood
Which spurns the check of salutary bands,
That this most famous Stream in bogs and sands
Should perish; and to evil and to good
Be lost for ever. In our halls is hung
Armoury of the invincible Knights of old:
We must be free or die, who speak the tongue
That Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold

Breathless with adoration; the broad sun 
Is sinking down in its tranquility; 
The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea; 
Listen! the mighty Being is awake, 
And doth with his eternal motion make 
A sound like thunder—everlastingly. 
Dear child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here, 
If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,

Have forfeited their ancient English dower
Of inward happiness. We are selfish men;
Oh! raise us up, return to us again;
And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power.
Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart:
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea:
Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,
So didst thou travel on life's common way,
In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart
The lowliest duties on herself did lay.",William Wordsworth,sonnet

That in ourselves our safety must be sought;
That by our own right hands it must be wrought;
That we must stand unpropped, or be laid low.
O dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer!
We shall exult, if they who rule the land
Be men who hold its many blessings dear,
Wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band,
Who are to judge of danger which they fear,
And honour which they do not understand.",William Wordsworth,sonnet

Even rich men, brave by nature, taint the air
With words of apprehension and despair:
While tens of thousands, thinking on the affray,

And minds not stinted or untilled are given,
Sound, healthy, children of the God of heaven,
Are cheerful as the rising sun in May.
What do we gather hence but firmer faith
That every gift of noble origin
Is breathed upon by Hope's perpetual breath;
That virtue and the faculties within
Are vital,—and that riches are akin
To fear, to change, to cowardice, and death?",William Wordsworth,sonnet
On the Extinction of the Venetian Republic,"Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee;
And was the safeguard of the west: the worth
Of Venice did not fall below her birth,
Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.
She was a maiden City, bright and free;
No guile seduced, no force could violate;
And, when she took unto herself a Mate,
She must espouse the everlasting Sea.
And what if she had seen those glories fade,
Those titles vanish, and that strength decay;
Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
When her long life hath reached its final day:
Men are we, and must grieve when even the Shade
Of that which once was great is passed away.",William Wordsworth,sonnet
The World Is Too Much With Us,"The world is too much with us; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—
Little we see in Nature that is ours;
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
The winds that will be howling at all hours,
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;
For this, for everything, we are out of tune;
It moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.",William Wordsworth,sonnet

Or groom! — We must run glittering like a brook
In the open sunshine, or we are unblest:
The wealthiest man among us is the best:
No grandeur now in nature or in book
Delights us. Rapine, avarice, expense,
This is idolatry; and these we adore:
Plain living and high thinking are no more:
The homely beauty of the good old cause
Is gone; our peace, our fearful innocence,
And pure religion breathing household laws.",William Wordsworth,sonnet

Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:
In truth the prison, into which we doom
Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,
In sundry moods, ’twas pastime to be bound

No eye can follow, to a fatal place

Rising like water from the soil, to find
In every nook a lip that it may cheer.",William Wordsworth,sonnet

Still glides the Stream, and shall for ever glide;
The Form remains, the Function never dies;
While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,
We Men, who in our morn of youth defied
The elements, must vanish;—be it so!
Enough, if something from our hands have power
To live, and act, and serve the future hour;
And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,
Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower,
We feel that we are greater than we know.",William Wordsworth,sonnet

Of nicely-calculated less or more;
So deemed the man who fashioned for the sense
These lofty pillars, spread that branching roof
Self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,
Where light and shade repose, where music dwells

Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
That they were born for immortality.",William Wordsworth,sonnet
Mutability,"From low to high doth dissolution climb,

Truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear
The longest date do melt like frosty rime,
That in the morning whitened hill and plain

Of yesterday, which royally did wear
His crown of weeds, but could not even sustain

With fancied roses, than the unblemished moon
Before her wane begins on heaven's blue coast;
Thy image falls to earth. Yet some, I ween,

Of high with low, celestial with terrene!",William Wordsworth,sonnet
Scorn not the Sonnet,"Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frowned,

Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned 
His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,

Of meditation, slipping in between
The beauty coming and the beauty gone.
If Thought and Love desert us, from that day

In fear that else, when Critics grave and cool
Have killed him, Scorn should write his epitaph.
How does the Meadow-flower its bloom unfold?

The vulgar stare to see her bid adieu;
 Her tattered garments fix their curious eyes.

Behold the tear bedew her cheeks!
Imploring actions, bursting sighs,
Reveal enough to British eyes.",Elizabeth Kirkham Mathews,sonnet
Work without Hope,"Lines Composed 21st February 1825

All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair—
The bees are stirring—birds are on the wing—
And Winter slumbering in the open air,
Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!
And I the while, the sole unbusy thing,
Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.

         Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,
Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.
Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,
For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!
With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll:
And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul?
Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,
And Hope without an object cannot live.",Samuel Taylor Coleridge,sonnet

Therefore on him no speech! and brief for thee, 
Browning! Since Chaucer was alive and hale, 
No man hath walkt along our roads with step 
So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue 
So varied in discourse. But warmer climes

Of Alpine highths thou playest with, borne on 
Beyond Sorrento and Amalfi, where 
The Siren waits thee, singing song for song.",Walter Savage Landor,sonnet

Keeping along it their eternal stands,—
Caves, pillars, pyramids, the shepherd bands
   That roamed through the young world, the glory extreme
   Of high Sesostris, and that southern beam,
The laughing queen that caught the world's great hands.

Then comes a mightier silence, stern and strong,
As of a world left empty of its throng,
   And the void weighs on us; and then we wake,
And hear the fruitful stream lapsing along
   Twixt villages, and think how we shall take
   Our own calm journey on for human sake.",Leigh Hunt,sonnet
Ozymandias,"I met a traveller from an antique land

Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”",Percy Bysshe Shelley,sonnet

Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shine
On some frail bark in winter’s midnight roar:
Thou hast like to a rock-built refuge stood

In honoured poverty thy voice did weave
Songs consecrate to truth and liberty,—
Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve,
Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to be.",Percy Bysshe Shelley,sonnet

Till they drop, blind in blood, without a blow.
A people starved and stabbed in th' untilled field;
An army, whom liberticide and prey
Makes as a two-edged sword to all who wield;
Golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay;

The boy that pecks the turnips all the day 
And knocks his hands to keep the cold away 
And laps his legs in straw to keep them warm 
And hides behind the hedges from the storm. 
The sheep, as tame as dogs, go where he goes 
And try to shake their fleeces from the snows, 
Then leave their frozen meal and wander round 
The stubble stack that stands beside the ground,

And shun the hovel where they might be warm.",John Clare,sonnet

Then crows, and looks about for little crumbs,
Swept out by little folks an hour ago;
The pigs sleep in the sty; the bookman comes—
The little boy lets home-close nesting go,

And gentle tale of love and languishment?
Returning home at evening, with an ear

 That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;
 Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
 When a new planet swims into his ken;
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
 He star'd at the Pacific—and all his men
Look'd at each other with a wild surmise—
 Silent, upon a peak in Darien.",John Keats,sonnet

Full in the smile of the blue firmament. 
Who is more happy, when, with heart's content, 
         Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair 
         Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair 
And gentle tale of love and languishment? 
Returning home at evening, with an ear 
         Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye 
Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career, 
         He mourns that day so soon has glided by: 
E'en like the passage of an angel's tear 
         That falls through the clear ether silently.",John Keats,sonnet
The Human Seasons,"Four Seasons fill the measure of the year;
     There are four seasons in the mind of man:
He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear
     Takes in all beauty with an easy span:
He has his Summer, when luxuriously
     Spring's honied cud of youthful thought he loves
To ruminate, and by such dreaming high
     Is nearest unto heaven: quiet coves
His soul has in its Autumn, when his wings
     He furleth close; contented so to look
On mists in idleness—to let fair things
     Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.
He has his Winter too of pale misfeature,
Or else he would forego his mortal nature.",John Keats,sonnet
"“Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art”","Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art—

And watching, with eternal lids apart,

The moving waters at their priestlike task 
         Of pure ablution round earth's human shores, 
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask 
         Of snow upon the mountains and the moors— 
No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable, 
         Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast, 
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, 
         Awake for ever in a sweet unrest, 
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath, 
And so live ever—or else swoon to death.",John Keats,sonnet
On Sitting Down to Read King Lear Once Again,"O golden-tongued Romance with serene lute! 
   Fair plumed Syren! Queen of far away! 
   Leave melodizing on this wintry day, 
Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute: 
Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute, 
   Betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay 
   Must I burn through; once more humbly assay 
The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit. 
Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion, 
   Begetters of our deep eternal theme, 
When through the old oak forest I am gone, 
   Let me not wander in a barren dream, 
But when I am consumed in the fire, 
Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire.",John Keats,sonnet
If By Dull Rhymes Our English Must Be Chain'd,"If by dull rhymes our English must be chain'd,

Fetter'd, in spite of pained loveliness; 
Let us find out, if we must be constrain'd, 
   Sandals more interwoven and complete 
To fit the naked foot of poesy; 
Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress 
Of every chord, and see what may be gain'd 
   By ear industrious, and attention meet: 
Misers of sound and syllable, no less 
   Than Midas of his coinage, let us be 
   Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown; 
So, if we may not let the Muse be free,

To Homer,"Standing aloof in giant ignorance,

So thou wast blind;—but then the veil was rent, 
   For Jove uncurtain'd Heaven to let thee live, 
And Neptune made for thee a spumy tent, 
   And Pan made sing for thee his forest-hive; 
Aye on the shores of darkness there is light, 
   And precipices show untrodden green, 
There is a budding morrow in midnight, 
   There is a triple sight in blindness keen; 
Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel

O soothest Sleep! if so it please thee, close
      In midst of this thine hymn my willing eyes,
Or wait the ""Amen,"" ere thy poppy throws
      Around my bed its lulling charities.
Then save me, or the passed day will shine
Upon my pillow, breeding many woes,—
      Save me from curious Conscience, that still lords
Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole;

And seal the hushed Casket of my Soul.",John Keats,sonnet
When I have Fears That I May Cease to Be,"When I have fears that I may cease to be

Before high-pilèd books, in charactery, 
   Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain; 
When I behold, upon the night’s starred face, 
   Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance, 
And think that I may never live to trace 
   Their shadows with the magic hand of chance; 
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour, 
   That I shall never look upon thee more, 
Never have relish in the faery power 
   Of unreflecting love—then on the shore 
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think 
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.",John Keats,sonnet
"Long time a child, and still a child, when years","Long time a child, and still a child, when years
Had painted manhood on my cheek, was I,—
For yet I lived like one not born to die;
A thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears,
No hope I needed, and I knew no fears.
But sleep, though sweet, is only sleep, and waking,
I waked to sleep no more, at once o’ertaking
The vanguard of my age, with all arrears
Of duty on my back. Nor child, nor man,
Nor youth, nor sage, I find my head is grey,
For I have lost the race I never ran:
A rathe December blights my lagging May;
And still I am a child, tho’ I be old,
Time is my debtor for my years untold.",Hartley Coleridge,sonnet
To a Deaf and Dumb Little Girl,"Like a loose island on the wide expanse,
Unconscious floating on the fickle sea,
Herself her all, she lives in privacy;
Her waking life as lonely as a trance,
Doom’d to behold the universal dance,
And never hear the music which expounds
The solemn step, coy slide, the merry bounds.
The vague, mute language of the countenance.
In vain for her I smooth my antic rhyme;
She cannot hear it. All her little being
Concentrated in her solitary seeing—
What can she know of beauty or sublime?
And yet methinks she looks so calm and good,
God must be with her in her solitude!",Hartley Coleridge,sonnet

Knowing you are faithless keeps me alive and hungry.   
Knowing you faithful would kill me with joy.   

Delicate are you, and your vows are delicate, too,   
so easily do they break.   

You are a laconic marksman. You leave me   
not dead but perpetually dying.   

I want my friends to heal me, succor me.   
Instead, I get analysis.   

Conflagrations that would make stones drip blood   
are campfires compared to my anguish.   

Two-headed, inescapable anguish!—
Love’s anguish or the anguish of time.   

Another dark, severing, incommunicable night.   
Death would be fine, if I only died once.   

I would have liked a solitary death,   
not this lavish funeral, this grave anyone can visit.

Silence,"There is a silence where hath been no sound, 
   There is a silence where no sound may be, 
   In the cold grave—under the deep deep sea, 
Or in the wide desert where no life is found, 
Which hath been mute, and still must sleep profound; 
   No voice is hush’d—no life treads silently, 
   But clouds and cloudy shadows wander free, 
That never spoke, over the idle ground: 
But in green ruins, in the desolate walls 
   Of antique palaces, where Man hath been, 
Though the dun fox, or wild hyena, calls, 
   And owls, that flit continually between, 
Shriek to the echo, and the low winds moan, 
There the true Silence is, self-conscious and alone.",Thomas Hood,sonnet
Sonnet to Vauxhall,"“The English Garden.”—Mason

The cold transparent ham is on my fork—
 It hardly rains—and hark the bell!—ding-dingle—
Away! Three thousand feet at gravel work,
 Mocking a Vauxhall shower!—Married and Single
Crush—rush;—Soak’d Silks with wet white Satin mingle.
 Hengler! Madame! round whom all bright sparks lurk
Calls audibly on Mr. and Mrs. Pringle
 To study the Sublime, &c.—(vide Burke)
All Noses are upturn’d!—Whish-ish!—On high
 The rocket rushes—trails—just steals in sight—
Then droops and melts in bubbles of blue light—
 And Darkness reigns—Then balls flare up and die—
Wheels whiz—smack crackers—serpents twist—and then
 Back to the cold transparent ham again!",Thomas Hood,sonnet
To -,"Vainly my heart had with thy sorceries striven:
It had no refuge from thy love,—no Heaven
But in thy fatal presence;—from afar
It owned thy power and trembled like a star
O’erfraught with light and splendor. Could I deem
How dark a shadow should obscure its beam?—
Could I believe that pain could ever dwell
Where thy bright presence cast its blissful spell?
Thou wert my proud palladium;—could I fear
The avenging Destinies when thou wert near?—
Thou wert my Destiny;—thy song, thy fame,
The wild enchantments clustering round thy name,
Were my soul’s heritage, its royal dower;
Its glory and its kingdom and its power!",Sarah Helen Whitman,sonnet

The ashes at thy feet. Behold and see
What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,
And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn
Through the ashen greyness. If thy foot in scorn
Could tread them out to darkness utterly,
It might be well perhaps. But if instead
Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow

Grief,"I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless—
That only men incredulous of despair,
Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air,
Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access
Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness
In souls, as countries, lieth silent-bare
Under the blenching, vertical eye-glare
Of the absolute Heavens. Deep-hearted man, express
Grief for thy Dead in silence like to death;

In everlasting watch and moveless woe,
Till itself crumble to the dust beneath!

I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.

In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.

Clear from the darkling ground, — content until
I sit with angels before better food.

Nature,"As a fond mother, when the day is o'er,
   Leads by the hand her little child to bed,
   Half willing, half reluctant to be led,
   And leave his broken playthings on the floor,
Still gazing at them through the open door,
   Nor wholly reassured and comforted
   By promises of others in their stead,
   Which, though more splendid, may not please him more;
So Nature deals with us, and takes away
   Our playthings one by one, and by the hand
   Leads us to rest so gently, that we go
Scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay,
   Being too full of sleep to understand
   How far the unknown transcends the what we know.",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,sonnet
Divina Commedia,"Oft have I seen at some cathedral door 
      A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat, 
      Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet 
      Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor 
Kneel to repeat his paternoster o'er; 
      Far off the noises of the world retreat; 
      The loud vociferations of the street 
      Become an undistinguishable roar. 
So, as I enter here from day to day, 
      And leave my burden at this minster gate, 
      Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray, 
The tumult of the time disconsolate 
      To inarticulate murmurs dies away, 
      While the eternal ages watch and wait. 
 
II 
How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers! 
      This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves 
      Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves 
      Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers, 
And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers! 
      But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves 
      Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves, 
      And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers! 
Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain, 
      What exultations trampling on despair, 
      What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong, 
What passionate outcry of a soul in pain, 
      Uprose this poem of the earth and air, 
      This mediæval miracle of song! 
 
I enter, and I see thee in the gloom 
      Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine! 
      And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine. 
      The air is filled with some unknown perfume; 
The congregation of the dead make room 
      For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine; 
      Like rooks that haunt Ravenna's groves of pine 
      The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb. 
From the confessionals I hear arise 
      Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies, 
      And lamentations from the crypts below; 
And then a voice celestial that begins 
      With the pathetic words, ""Although your sins 
      As scarlet be,"" and ends with ""as the snow."" 
 
With snow-white veil and garments as of flame, 
      She stands before thee, who so long ago 
      Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe 
      From which thy song and all its splendors came; 
And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name, 
      The ice about thy heart melts as the snow 
      On mountain heights, and in swift overflow 
      Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame. 
Thou makest full confession; and a gleam, 
      As of the dawn on some dark forest cast, 
      Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase; 
Lethe and Eunoë — the remembered dream 
      And the forgotten sorrow — bring at last 
      That perfect pardon which is perfect peace. 
 
I lift mine eyes, and all the windows blaze 
      With forms of Saints and holy men who died, 
      Here martyred and hereafter glorified; 
      And the great Rose upon its leaves displays 
Christ's Triumph, and the angelic roundelays, 
      With splendor upon splendor multiplied; 
      And Beatrice again at Dante's side 
      No more rebukes, but smiles her words of praise. 
And then the organ sounds, and unseen choirs 
      Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love 
      And benedictions of the Holy Ghost; 
And the melodious bells among the spires 
      O'er all the house-tops and through heaven above 
      Proclaim the elevation of the Host! 
 
O star of morning and of liberty! 
      O bringer of the light, whose splendor shines 
      Above the darkness of the Apennines, 
      Forerunner of the day that is to be! 
The voices of the city and the sea, 
      The voices of the mountains and the pines, 
      Repeat thy song, till the familiar lines 
      Are footpaths for the thought of Italy! 
Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights, 
      Through all the nations, and a sound is heard, 
      As of a mighty wind, and men devout, 
Strangers of Rome, and the new proselytes,

Keats,"The young Endymion sleeps Endymion's sleep; 
      The shepherd-boy whose tale was left half told! 
      The solemn grove uplifts its shield of gold 
      To the red rising moon, and loud and deep 
The nightingale is singing from the steep; 
      It is midsummer, but the air is cold; 
      Can it be death? Alas, beside the fold 
      A shepherd's pipe lies shattered near his sheep. 
Lo! in the moonlight gleams a marble white, 
      On which I read: ""Here lieth one whose name 
      Was writ in water."" And was this the meed 
Of his sweet singing? Rather let me write: 
      ""The smoking flax before it burst to flame 
      Was quenched by death, and broken the bruised reed.""",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,sonnet
Milton,"I pace the sounding sea-beach and behold 
      How the voluminous billows roll and run, 
      Upheaving and subsiding, while the sun 
      Shines through their sheeted emerald far unrolled, 
And the ninth wave, slow gathering fold by fold 
      All its loose-flowing garments into one, 
      Plunges upon the shore, and floods the dun 
      Pale reach of sands, and changes them to gold. 
So in majestic cadence rise and fall 
      The mighty undulations of thy song, 
      O sightless bard, England's Mæonides! 
And ever and anon, high over all 
      Uplifted, a ninth wave superb and strong, 
      Floods all the soul with its melodious seas.",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,sonnet
Shakespeare,"A vision as of crowded city streets, 
      With human life in endless overflow; 
      Thunder of thoroughfares; trumpets that blow 
      To battle; clamor, in obscure retreats, 
Of sailors landed from their anchored fleets; 
      Tolling of bells in turrets, and below 
      Voices of children, and bright flowers that throw 
      O'er garden-walls their intermingled sweets! 
This vision comes to me when I unfold 
      The volume of the Poet paramount, 
      Whom all the Muses loved, not one alone; — 
Into his hands they put the lyre of gold, 
      And, crowned with sacred laurel at their fount, 
      Placed him as Musagetes on their throne.",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,sonnet
The Cross of Snow,"In the long, sleepless watches of the night, 
   A gentle face — the face of one long dead — 
   Looks at me from the wall, where round its head 
   The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light. 
Here in this room she died; and soul more white 
   Never through martyrdom of fire was led 
   To its repose; nor can in books be read 
   The legend of a life more benedight. 
There is a mountain in the distant West 
   That, sun-defying, in its deep ravines 
   Displays a cross of snow upon its side. 
Such is the cross I wear upon my breast 
   These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes 
   And seasons, changeless since the day she died.",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,sonnet
Sonnet—﻿To Science,"Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art! 
   Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes. 
Why preyest thou thus upon the poet’s heart,

How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise, 
   Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering 
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies, 
   Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing? 
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car, 
   And driven the Hamadryad from the wood 
To seek a shelter in some happier star? 
   Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood, 
The Elfin from the green grass, and from me 
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?",Edgar Allan Poe,sonnet
from The Princess: Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal,"Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;
Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;
Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font.
The firefly wakens; waken thou with me.

   Now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost,
And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.

   Now lies the Earth all Danaë to the stars,
And all thy heart lies open unto me.

   Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves
A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.

   Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,
And slips into the bosom of the lake.
So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip
Into my bosom and be lost in me.","Alfred, Lord Tennyson",sonnet
To Shakespeare,"Oft, when my lips I open to rehearse 
Thy wondrous spell of wisdom, and of power, 
And that my voice, and thy immortal verse, 
On listening ears, and hearts, I mingled pour, 
I shrink dismayed – and awful doth appear 
The vain presumption of my own weak deed; 
Thy glorious spirit seems to mine so near, 
That suddenly I tremble as I read – 
Thee an invisible auditor I fear: 
Oh, if it might be so, my master dear! 
With what beseeching would I pray to thee, 
To make me equal to my noble task, 
Succor from thee, how humbly would I ask, 
Thy worthiest works to utter worthily.",Frances Anne Kemble,sonnet
Flaxman,"We deemed the secret lost, the spirit gone,
Which spake in Greek simplicity of thought,
And in the forms of gods and heroes wrought
Eternal beauty from the sculptured stone,—
A higher charm than modern culture won
With all the wealth of metaphysic lore,
Gifted to analyze, dissect, explore.
A many-colored light flows from one sun;
Art, ’neath its beams, a motley thread has spun;
The prism modifies the perfect day;
But thou hast known such mediums to shun,
And cast once more on life a pure, white ray.
Absorbed in the creations of thy mind,
Forgetting daily self, my truest self I find.",Margaret Fuller,sonnet

Thought and feeling and soul and sense— 
Merged in a moment which gives me at last 
You around me for once, you beneath me, above me— 
Me—sure that despite of time future, time past,— 
This tick of our life-time’s one moment you love me! 
How long such suspension may linger? Ah, Sweet—

While cheeks burn, arms open, eyes shut and lips meet!",Robert Browning,sonnet
Thy Brother’s Blood,"I have no Brother,—they who meet me now
Offer a hand with their own wills defiled,
And, while they wear a smooth unwrinkled brow,
Know not that Truth can never be beguiled;
Go wash the hand that still betrays thy guilt;
Before the spirit’s gaze what stain can hide?
Abel’s red blood upon the earth is spilt,
And by thy tongue it cannot be denied;
I hear not with my ear,—the heart doth tell
Its secret deeds to me untold before;
Go, all its hidden plunder quickly sell,
Then shalt thou cleanse thee from thy brother’s gore,
Then will I take thy gift; that bloody stain
Shall not be seen upon thy hand again.",Jones Very,sonnet
The Hand and Foot,"The hand and foot that stir not, they shall find 
Sooner than all the rightful place to go; 
Now in their motion free as roving wind, 
Though first no snail more limited and slow; 
I mark them full of labor all the day, 
Each active motion made in perfect rest; 
They cannot from their path mistaken stray, 
Though ’tis not theirs, yet in it they are blest; 
The bird has not their hidden track found out, 
Nor cunning fox, though full of art he be; 
It is the way unseen, the certain route, 
Where ever bound, yet thou art ever free; 
The path of Him, whose perfect law of love 
Bids spheres and atoms in just order move.",Jones Very,sonnet
Yourself,"’Tis to yourself I speak; you cannot know
Him whom I call in speaking such an one,
For thou beneath the earth lie buried low,
Which he alone as living walks upon;
Thou mayst at times have heard him speak to you,
And often wished perchance that you were he;
And I must ever wish that it were true,
For then thou couldst hold fellowship with me;
But now thou hear’st us talk as strangers, met
Above the room wherein thou liest abed;
A word perhaps loud spoken thou mayst get,
Or hear our feet when heavily they tread;
But he who speaks, or him who’s spoken to,
Must both remain as strangers still to you.",Jones Very,sonnet

In the morning of thy day, 
Bound in everlasting gloom, 
Buried in a hapless tomb.

Chain and bar and dungeon wall 
Saved thee from a deadlier thrall.

Thank the power that made thee part 
Ere that parting broke thy heart.

The roses on thy cheek that come and go, 
    When in thy azure eyes the smiles awake,

No passing winds the liquid mirror wake, 
    The cool refreshing airs so softly blow. 
But hidden currents in the depths below
    The angry surface in an instant shake.

Gaze then in safety from the emerald shore; 
    Nor launch thy shallop on the treacherous wave. 
Even the gentle touch of thy light oar
    May rouse the slumbering peril from its grave. 
Thy fragile bark is on rough waters tossed; 
    The picture fades, thou sinkest, and art lost.",Hermogénes Irisarri,sonnet
Misgivings,"When ocean-clouds over inland hills
   Sweep storming in late autumn brown,
 And horror the sodden valley fills,

 The tempest bursting from the waste of Time
On the world’s fairest hope linked with man’s foulest crime.

 Nature’s dark side is heeded now—
   (Ah! optimist-cheer disheartened flown)—

   Of yon black mountain lone.
 With shouts the torrents down the gorges go,
 And storms are formed behind the storm we feel:
The hemlock shakes in the rafter, the oak in the driving keel.",Herman Melville,sonnet
Patroling Barnegat,"Wild, wild the storm, and the sea high running,

On beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting, 
Where through the murk the easterly death-wind breasting, 
Through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing, 
(That in the distance! is that a wreck? is the red signal flaring?) 
 
Slush and sand of the beach tireless till daylight wending, 
Steadily, slowly, through hoarse roar never remitting, 
Along the midnight edge by those milk-white combs careering, 
A group of dim, weird forms, struggling, the night confronting, 
That savage trinity warily watching.",Walt Whitman,sonnet

Dank fens of cedar; hemlock-branches gray

Beds of the black pitchpine in dead leaves set
Whose wasted red has wasted to white away;
Remnants of rain and droppings of decay, —
Why hold ye so my heart, nor dimly let
Through your deep leaves the light of yesterday,
The faded glimmer of a sunshine set?
Is it that in your darkness, shut from strife,
The bread of tears becomes the bread of life?
Far from the roar of day, beneath your boughs
Fresh griefs beat tranquilly, and loves and vows
Grow green in your gray shadows, dearer far
Even than all lovely lights and roses are?",Frederick Goddard Tuckerman,sonnet

Roll on, sad world! not Mercury or Mars
Could swifter speed, or slower, round the sun,
Than in this year of variance thou hast done
For me. Yet pain, fear, heart-break, woes, and wars
Have natural limit; from his dread eclipse
The swift sun hastens, and the night debars
The day, but to bring in the day more bright;
The flowers renew their odorous fellowships;
The moon runs round and round; the slow earth dips,
True to her poise, and lifts; the planet-stars
Roll and return from circle to ellipse;
The day is dull and soft, the eave-trough drips;
And yet I know the splendor of the light
Will break anon: look! where the gray is white!",Frederick Goddard Tuckerman,sonnet

And Change, with hurried hand, has swept these scenes:
The woods have fallen; across the meadow-lot
The hunter’s trail and trap-path is forgot;
And fire has drunk the swamps of evergreens!
Yet for a moment let my fancy plant
These autumn hills again,—the wild dove’s haunt,
The wild deer’s walk. In golden umbrage shut,
The Indian river runs, Quonecktacut!
Here, but a lifetime back, where falls to-night
Behind the curtained pane a sheltered light
On buds of rose, or vase of violet
Aloft upon the marble mantel set,—

How oft in schoolboy-days, from the school’s sway
Have I run forth to Nature as to a friend,—
With some pretext of o’erwrought sight, to spend
My school-time in green meadows far away!
Careless of summoning bell, or clocks that strike,
I marked with flowers the minutes of my day:
For still the eye that shrank from hated hours,
Dazzled with decimal and dividend,
Knew each bleached alder-root that plashed across
The bubbling brook, and every mass of moss;
Could tell the month, too, by the vervain-spike,—
How far the ring of purple tiny flowers
Had climbed; just starting, may-be, with the May,
Half-light, or tapering off at Summer’s end.",Frederick Goddard Tuckerman,sonnet

Yet, even ‘mid merry boyhood’s tricks and scapes,

Wandering alone by many a mile burnt
Black woodside, that but the snow-flake decks and drapes.
And I have stood beneath Canadian sky,
In utter solitudes, where the cricket’s cry
Appals the heart, and fear takes visible shapes;
And on Long Island’s void and isolate capes
Heard the sea break like iron bars: and still,
In all, I seemed to hear the same deep dirge;
Borne in the wind, the insect’s tiny trill,
And crash and jangle of the shaking surge;
And knew not what they meant,—prophetic woe?
Dim bodings, wherefore? Now, indeed, I know!",Frederick Goddard Tuckerman,sonnet

With common sandgrass, skirt the horizon line,
And over these the incorruptible blue!

All world asperities, lightly touched and smoothed
As by his gracious hand, the great Bestower.
What though the year be late? some colors run
Yet through the dry, some links of melody.

How well do I recall that walk in state
Across the Common, by the paths we knew:
Myself in silver badge and riband blue,
My little sister with her book and slate;
The elm tree by the Pond, the fence of wood,
The burial place that at the corner stood
Where once we crossed, through the forbidden grate,
The stones that grudg’d us way, the graveside weed,
The ominous wind that turned us half about.
Smit the flying drops, at what a speed
Across the paths, unblessed and unforgiven
We hurried homeward when the day was late
And heard, with awe that left no place for doubt,
God’s anger mutter in the darkened heaven.",Frederick Goddard Tuckerman,sonnet
Immortality,"Foil'd by our fellow-men, depress'd, outworn,
We leave the brutal world to take its way,
And, Patience! in another life, we say
The world shall be thrust down, and we up-borne.

And will not, then, the immortal armies scorn
The world's poor, routed leavings? or will they,
Who fail'd under the heat of this life's day,
Support the fervours of the heavenly morn?

No, no! the energy of life may be
Kept on after the grave, but not begun;
And he who flagg'd not in the earthly strife,

From strength to strength advancing—only he,
His soul well-knit, and all his battles won,
Mounts, and that hardly, to eternal life.",Matthew Arnold,sonnet

And drudge under some foolish master's ken
Who rates us if we peer outside our pen—
Match'd with a palace, is not this a hell?

Even in a palace! On his truth sincere,
Who spoke these words, no shadow ever came;
And when my ill-school'd spirit is aflame

Some nobler, ampler stage of life to win,
I'll stop, and say: ""There were no succour here!
The aids to noble life are all within.""",Matthew Arnold,sonnet

O visage of still music in the sky!
Soft moon! I feel thy song, m y fairest friend!
True harmony within can apprehend
Dumb harmony without. And hard! ’t is nigh!
Belief has struck the note of sound: a gleam
Of living silver shows me where she shook
Her long white fingers down the shadowy brook,

Her character of large-browed steadfastness.

From Providence or me? She is not one

The less can I forgive, though I adore
That cruel lovely pallor which surrounds
Her footsteps; and the low vibrating sounds
That come on me, as from a magic shore.
Low are they, but most subtle to find out
The shrinking soul. Madam, ’t is understood
When women play upon their womanhood;
It means, a Season gone. And yet I doubt
But I am duped. That nun-like look waylays
My fancy! Oh!  I do but wait a sign!
Pluck out the eyes of pride! thy mouth to mind!
Never! though I die thirsting. Go thy ways!",George Meredith,sonnet
Modern Love: XXIII,"’Tis Christmas weather, and a country house
Receives us: rooms are full: we can but get
An attic-crib. Such lovers will not fret
At that, it is half-said. The great carouse
Knocks hard upon the midnight’s hollow door,
But when I knock at hers, see the pit.
Why did I come here in that dullard fit?
I enter, and lie couched upon the floor.
Passing, I caught the coverlet’s quick beat:—
Come, Shame, burn to my soul! and Pride, and Pain—
Foul demons that have tortured me, enchain!
Out in the freezing darkness the lambs bleat.
The small bird stiffens in the low starlight.
I know not how, but shuddering as I slept,
I dreamed a banished angel to me crept:
My feet were nourished on her breasts all night.",George Meredith,sonnet
Modern Love: XX," I am not of those miserable males
Who sniff at vice, and, daring not to snap,
Do therefore hope for heaven. I take the hap
Of all my deeds. The wind that fills my sails,
Propels; but I am helmsman. Am I wrecked,
I know the devil has sufficient weight
To bear: I lay it not on him, or fate.
Besides, he’s damned. That man I do suspect
A coward, who would burden the poor deuce
With what ensues from his own slipperiness.
I have just found a wanton-scented tress
In an old desk, dusty for lack of use.
Of days and nights it is demonstrative,
That, like some aged star, gleam luridly.
If for those times I must ask charity,
Have I not any charity to give?",George Meredith,sonnet
Modern Love: XII," 
Not solely that the Future she destroys,
And the fair life which in the distance lies
For all men, beckoning out from dim rich skies:
Nor that the passing hour’s supporting joys
Have lost the keen-edged flavour, which begat
Distinction in old times, and still should breed
Sweet Memory, and Hope,—earth’s modest seed,
And heaven’s high prompting: not that the world is flat
Since that soft-luring creature I embraced,
Among the children of Illusion went:
Methinks with all this loss I were content,
If the mad Past, on which my foot is based,
Were firm, or might be blotted: but the whole
Of life is mixed: the mocking Past will stay:
And if I drink oblivion of a day,
So shorten I the stature of my soul.
 
 ",George Meredith,sonnet
Modern Love: XI," 
Out in the yellow meadows, where the bee
Hums by us with the honey of the Spring,
And showers of sweet notes from the larks on wing,
Are dropping like a noon-dew, wander we.
Or is it now? or was it then? for now,
As then, the larks from running rings pour showers:
The golden foot of May is on the flowers,
And friendly shadows dance upon her brow.
What’s this, when Nature swears there is no change
To challenge eyesight? Now, as then, the grace
Of heaven seems holding earth in its embrace.
Nor eyes, nor heart, has she to feel it strange?
Look, woman, in the West. There wilt thou see
An amber cradle near the sun’s decline:
Within it, featured even in death divine,
Is lying a dead infant, slain by thee.
 
 ",George Meredith,sonnet
Modern Love: IX," 
He felt the wild beast in him between whiles
So masterfully rude, that he would grieve
To see the helpless delicate thing receive
His guardianship through certain dark defiles.
Had he not teeth to rend, and hunger too?
But still be spared her. Once: ‘Have you no fear?’
He said: ’t was dusk; she in his grasp; none near.
She laughed: ‘No, surely; am I not with you?’
And uttering that soft starry ‘you,’ she leaned
 Her gentle body near him, looking up;
And from her eyes, as from a poison-cup,
He drank until the flittering eyelids screened.
Devilish malignant witch! and oh, young beam
Of heaven’s circle-glory! Here thy shape
To squeeze like an intoxicating grape—
I might, and yet thou goest safe, supreme.
 
 ",George Meredith,sonnet
Modern Love: VIII," 
Yet it was plain she struggled, and that salt
Of righteous feeling made her pitiful.
Poor twisting worm, so queenly beautiful!
Where came the cleft between us? whose the fault?
My tears are on thee, that have rarely dropped
As balm for any bitter wound of mine:
My breast will open for thee at a sign!
But no: we are two reed-pipes, coarsely stopped:
The God once filled them with his mellow breath;
And they were music till he flung them down,
Used! used! Hear now the discord-loving clown
Puff his gross spirit in them, worse than death!
I do not know myself without thee more:
In this unholy battle I grow base:
If the same soul be under the same face,
Speak, and a taste of that old time restore!
 
 ",George Meredith,sonnet
Modern Love: V," 
A message from her set his brain aflame.
A world of household matters filled her mind,
Wherein he saw hypocrisy designed:
She treated him as something that is tame,
And but at other provocation bites.
Familiar was her shoulder in the glass,
Through that dark rain: yet it may come to pass
That a changed eye finds such familiar sights
More keenly tempting than new loveliness.
The ‘What has been’ a moment seemed his own:
The splendours, mysteries, dearer because known,
Nor less divine: Love’s inmost sacredness,
Called to him, ‘Come!’—In his restraining start,
Eyes nurtured to be looked at, scarce could see
A wave of the great waves of Destiny
Convulsed at a checked impulse of the heart.
 
 ",George Meredith,sonnet
Modern Love: III," 
This was the woman; what now of the man?
But pass him. If he comes beneath a heel,
He shall be crushed until he cannot feel,
Or, being callous, haply till he can.
But he is nothing:—nothing? Only mark
The rich light striking out from her on him!
Ha! what a sense it is when her eyes swim
Across the man she singles, leaving dark
All else! Lord God, who mad’st the thing so fair,
See that I am drawn to her even now!
It cannot be such harm on her cool brow
To put a kiss? Yet if meet him there!
But she is mine! Ah, no! I know too well
I claim a star whose light is overcast:
I claim a phantom-woman in the Past.
The hour has struck, though I heard not the bell!
 
 ",George Meredith,sonnet
Modern Love: II,"It ended, and the morrow brought the task.
Her eyes were guilty gates, that let him in
By shutting all too zealous for their sin:
Each sucked a secret, and each wore a mask.
But, oh, the bitter taste her beauty had!
Her sickened as at breath of poison-flowers:
A languid humour stole among the hours,
And if their smiles encountered, he went mad,
And raged, deep inward, till the light was brown
Before his vision, and the world forgot,
Looked wicked as some old dull murder-spot.
A star with lurid beams, she seemed to crown
The pit of infamy: and then again
He fainted on his vengefulness, and strove
To ape the magnanimity of love,
And smote himself, a shuddering heap of pain.
 
 ",George Meredith,sonnet
Modern Love: I,"By this he knew she wept with waking eyes:
That, at his hand's light quiver by her head,
The strange low sobs that shook their common bed
Were called into her with a sharp surprise,
And strangled mute, like little gaping snakes,
Dreadfully venomous to him. She lay
Stone-still, and the long darkness flowed away
With muffled pulses. Then, as midnight makes
Her giant heart of Memory and Tears
Drink the pale drug of silence, and so beat
Sleep's heavy measure, they from head to feet
Were moveless, looking through their dead black years,
By vain regret scrawled over the blank wall.
Like sculptured effigies they might be seen
Upon their marriage-tomb, the sword between;
Each wishing for the sword that severs all.",George Meredith,sonnet
Sonnet:  I Thank You,"I thank you, kind and best beloved friend, 
With the same thanks one murmurs to a sister, 
When, for some gentle favor, he hath kissed her, 
Less for the gifts than for the love you send,
Less for the flowers, than what the flowers convey; 
If I, indeed, divine their meaning truly, 
And not unto myself ascribe, unduly,
Things which you neither meant nor wished to say, 
Oh! tell me, is the hope then all misplaced? 
And am I flattered by my own affection? 
But in your beauteous gift, methought I traced 
Something above a short-lived predilection, 
And which, for that I know no dearer name, 
I designate as love, without love’s flame.",Henry Timrod,sonnet
Sonnet: I Scarcely Grieve,"I scarcely grieve, O Nature! at the lot 
That pent my life within a city’s bounds, 
And shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds. 
Perhaps I had not learned, if some lone cot 
Had nursed a dreamy childhood, what the mart 
Taught me amid its turmoil; so my youth 
Had missed full many a stern but wholesome truth. 
Here, too, O Nature! in this haunt of Art, 
Thy power is on me, and I own thy thrall. 
There is no unimpressive spot on earth! 
The beauty of the stars is over all, 
And Day and Darkness visit every hearth. 
Clouds do not scorn us: yonder factory’s smoke 
Looked like a golden mist when morning broke.",Henry Timrod,sonnet
Sonnet:  Grief Dies,"Grief dies like joy; the tears upon my cheek 
Will disappear like dew. Dear God! I know 
Thy kindly Providence hath made it so,
And thank thee for the law. I am too weak 
To make a friend of Sorrow, or to wear, 
With that dark angel ever by my side
(Though to thy heaven there be no better guide), 
A front of manly calm. Yet, for I hear
How woe hath cleansed, how grief can deify,
So weak a thing it seems that grief should die, 
And love and friendship with it, I could pray, 
That if it might not gloom upon my brow, 
Nor weigh upon my arm as it doth now,
No grief of mine should ever pass away.",Henry Timrod,sonnet
Sonnet: They Dub Thee Idler,"They dub thee idler, smiling sneeringly, 
And why? because, forsooth, so many moons, 
Here dwelling voiceless by the voiceful sea, 
Thou hast not set thy thoughts to paltry tunes 
In song or sonnet. Them these golden noons 
Oppress not with their beauty; they could prate, 
Even while a prophet read the solemn runes 
On which is hanging some imperial fate. 
How know they, these good gossips, what to thee 
The ocean and its wanderers may have brought? 
How know they, in their busy vacancy, 
With what far aim thy spirit may be fraught? 
Or that thou dost not bow thee silently 
Before some great unutterable thought?",Henry Timrod,sonnet
Mary's Girlhood (for a Picture),"This is that blessed Mary, pre-elect
     God's Virgin. Gone is a great while, and she
     Dwelt young in Nazareth of Galilee.
Unto God's will she brought devout respect,
Profound simplicity of intellect,
     And supreme patience. From her mother's knee
     Faithful and hopeful; wise in charity;
Strong in grave peace; in pity circumspect.

So held she through her girlhood; as it were
     An angel-water'd lily, that near God
          Grows and is quiet. Till, one dawn at home,
She woke in her white bed, and had no fear
     At all,—yet wept till sunshine, and felt aw'd:

Unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen

Of ultimate things unutter'd the frail screen.

Mark me, how still I am! But should there dart
     One moment through thy soul the soft surprise

O'er vanish'd hours and hours eventual.

Even so much life hath the poor tress of hair
     Which, stor'd apart, is all love hath to show

Shall leap, as fountains veil the changing sky.

Now kiss, and think that there are really those,

Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fly 
Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:—

And oft from mine own spirit's hurtling harms
     I crave the refuge of her deep embrace,—
     Against all ills the fortified strong place
And sweet reserve of sovereign counter-charms.

And Love, our light at night and shade at noon,
     Lulls us to rest with songs, and turns away
     All shafts of shelterless tumultuous day.

When in the firelight steadily aglow,
Joined slackly, we beheld the red chasm grow
Among the clicking coals. Our library-bower
That eve was left to us: and hushed we sat
As lovers to whom Time is whispering.
From sudden-opened doors we heard them sing:
The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat.
Well knew we that Life's greatest treasure lay
With us, and of it was our talk. ""Ah, yes!
Love dies!"" I said: I never thought it less.
She yearned to me that sentence to unsay.

That all the household things are things she knew.
She stops before the glass. What sight in view?
A face that seems the latest to reveal!
For she turns from it hastily, and tossed
Irresolute, steals shadow-like to where
I stand; and wavering pale before me there,
Her tears fall still as oak-leaves after frost.
She will not speak. I will not ask. We are
League-sundered by the silent gulf between.

Yours is a lower, and a happier star!",George Meredith,sonnet

About the sounding of the Matin-bell,

Of loneliness was round me. Then I rose,
And my disordered brain did guide my foot
To that old wood where our first love-salute
Was interchanged: the source of many throes!
There did I see her, not alone. I moved
Toward her, and made proffer of my arm.
She took it simply, with no rude alarm;
And that disturbing shadow passed reproved.
I felt the pained speech coming, and declared
My firm belief in her, ere she could speak.
A ghastly morning came into her cheek,
While with a widening soul on me she stared.",George Meredith,sonnet

Condemned to do the flitting of the bat.
Lovers beneath the singing sky of May,
They wandered once; clear as the dew on flowers:
But they fed not on the advancing hours:
Their hearts held cravings for the buried day.
Then each applied to each that fatal knife,
Deep questioning, which probes to endless dole.
Ah, what a dusty answer gets the soul

And when I am a-weary not to seem.
Let the round world roll on; let the sun beam;
    Let the wind blow, and let the rivers fill
    The everlasting sea, and on the hill
The palms almost touch heaven, as children deem.
And, though young spring and summer pass away,
    And autumn and cold winter come again,
    And though my soul, being tired of its pain,
Pass from the ancient earth, and though my clay

Flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips;

   Bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show;
And one was blue with famine after love,
   Who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low
The burden of what those were singing of.
One shamed herself in love; one temperately
   Grew gross in soulless love, a sluggish wife;
One famished died for love. Thus two of three
   Took death for love and won him after strife;
One droned in sweetness like a fattened bee:

         Only remember me; you understand 
It will be late to counsel then or pray. 
Yet if you should forget me for a while 
         And afterwards remember, do not grieve:

What though from humble source the chorus floats? 
   Music is music, and I listen still; 
I have ‘an ear’, — ay, two! — Even jews-harp notes 
   Pass current with me, hear them where I will, 
A slight Italian boy, with jetty hair 
   Shading dark eyes, grinds out the melody, 
Pulverized music! — In his garb and air

O heart whose beating blood was running song,

A Sequence of Sonnets on the Death of Robert Browning,"I 
The clearest eyes in all the world they read 
       With sense more keen and spirit of sight more true 
       Than burns and thrills in sunrise, when the dew 
Flames, and absorbs the glory round it shed, 
As they the light of ages quick and dead, 
       Closed now, forsake us: yet the shaft that slew 
       Can slay not one of all the works we knew, 
Nor death discrown that many-laurelled head. 
 
The works of words whose life seems lightning wrought, 
And moulded of unconquerable thought, 
       And quickened with imperishable flame, 
Stand fast and shine and smile, assured that nought 
       May fade of all their myriad-moulded fame, 
       Nor England's memory clasp not Browning's name.

Death, what hast thou to do with one for whom 
       Time is not lord, but servant? What least part 
       Of all the fire that fed his living heart, 
Of all the light more keen that sundawn's bloom 
That lit and led his spirit, strong as doom 
       And bright as hope, can aught thy breath may dart 
       Quench? Nay, thou knowest he knew thee what thou art, 
A shadow born of terror's barren womb, 
That brings not forth save shadows. What art thou, 
To dream, albeit thou breathe upon his brow, 
       That power on him is given thee,—that thy breath 
Can make him less than love acclaims him now, 
       And hears all time sound back the word it saith? 
       What part hast thou then in his glory, Death? 
 
III 
A graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve: 
       Venice and winter, hand in deadly hand, 
       Have slain the lover of her sunbright strand 
And singer of a stormbright Christmas Eve. 
A graceless guerdon we that loved receive 
       For all our love, from that the dearest land 
       Love worshipped ever. Blithe and soft and bland, 
Too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave, 
Shone on our dreams and memories evermore 
The domes, the towers, the mountains and the shore 
       That gird or guard thee, Venice: cold and black 
Seems now the face we loved as he of yore. 
       We have given thee love—no stint, no stay, no lack: 
       What gift, what gift is this thou hast given us back? 
 
IV 
But he—to him, who knows what gift is thine, 
       Death? Hardly may we think or hope, when we 
       Pass likewise thither where to-night is he, 
Beyond the irremeable outer seas that shine 
And darken round such dreams as half divine 
       Some sunlit harbour in that starless sea 
       Where gleams no ship to windward or to lee, 
To read with him the secret of thy shrine. 
 
There too, as here, may song, delight, and love, 
The nightingale, the sea-bird, and the dove, 
       Fulfil with joy the splendour of the sky 
Till all beneath wax bright as all above: 
       But none of all that search the heavens, and try 
       The sun, may match the sovereign eagle's eye. 
 
V 
Among the wondrous ways of men and time 
       He went as one that ever found and sought 
       And bore in hand the lamp-like spirit of thought 
To illume with instance of its fire sublime 
The dusk of many a cloudlike age and clime. 
       No spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought, 
       No faith, no fear, no dream, no rapture, nought 
That blooms in wisdom, nought that burns in crime, 
No virtue girt and armed and helmed with light, 
No love more lovely than the snows are white, 
       No serpent sleeping in some dead soul's tomb, 
No song-bird singing from some live soul's height, 
       But he might hear, interpret, or illume 
       With sense invasive as the dawn of doom. 
 
VI 
What secret thing of splendour or of shade 
       Surmised in all those wandering ways wherein 
       Man, led of love and life and death and sin, 
Strays, climbs, or cowers, allured, absorbed, afraid, 
Might not the strong and sunlike sense invade 
       Of that full soul that had for aim to win 
       Light, silent over time's dark toil and din, 
Life, at whose touch death fades as dead things fade? 
O spirit of man, what mystery moves in thee 
That he might know not of in spirit, and see 
       The heart within the heart that seems to strive, 
The life within the life that seems to be, 
       And hear, through all thy storms that whirl and drive, 
       The living sound of all men's souls alive? 
 
VII 
He held no dream worth waking: so he said, 
       He who stands now on death's triumphal steep, 
       Awakened out of life wherein we sleep 
And dream of what he knows and sees, being dead. 
But never death for him was dark or dread: 
       ""Look forth"" he bade the soul, and fear not. Weep, 
       All ye that trust not in his truth, and keep 
Vain memory's vision of a vanished head 
As all that lives of all that once was he 
Save that which lightens from his word: but we, 
       Who, seeing the sunset-coloured waters roll, 
Yet know the sun subdued not of the sea, 
       Nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole, 
       And life and death but shadows of the soul.",Algernon Charles Swinburne,sonnet
Hap,"If but some vengeful god would call to me
From up the sky, and laugh: ""Thou suffering thing,
Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy,
that thy love's loss is my hate's profiting!""

Then would I bear it, clench myself, and die,
Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited;
Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I
Had willed and meted me the tears I shed.

But not so.  How arrives it joy lies slain,
And why unblooms the best hope ever sown?
--Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain,
And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan. . .
These purblind Doomsters had as readily strown
Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain.",Thomas Hardy,sonnet
The Pity of It,"April 1915

I walked in loamy Wessex lanes, afar 
From rail-track and from highway, and I heard 
In field and farmstead many an ancient word 
Of local lineage like 'Thu bist,' 'Er war,' 
'Ich woll', 'Er sholl', and by-talk similar, 
Nigh as they speak who in this month's moon gird 
At England's very loins, thereunto spurred 
By gangs whose glory threats and slaughters are. 
Then seemed a Heart crying: 'Whosoever they be 
At root and bottom of this, who flung this flame 
Between kin folk kin tongued even as are we, 
'Sinister, ugly, lurid, be their fame; 
May their familiars grow to shun their name, 
And their brood perish everlastingly.'",Thomas Hardy,sonnet
The Sea and the Skylark,"On ear and ear two noises too old to end
     Trench—right, the tide that ramps against the shore;
     With a flood or a fall, low lull-off or all roar,
Frequenting there while moon shall wear and wend.

Left hand, off land, I hear the lark ascend,
     His rash-fresh re-winded new-skeinèd score
     In crisps of curl off wild winch whirl, and pour
And pelt music, till none’s to spill nor spend.

How these two shame this shallow and frail town!
     How ring right out our sordid turbid time,
Being pure! We, life’s pride and cared-for crown,

     Have lost that cheer and charm of earth’s past prime:
Our make and making break, are breaking, down
     To man’s last dust, drain fast towards man’s first slime.",Gerard Manley Hopkins,sonnet
God's Grandeur,"The world is charged with the grandeur of God.
   It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;
   It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil
Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;
   And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;
   And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.

And for all this, nature is never spent;
   There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;
And though the last lights off the black West went
   Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs--
Because the Holy Ghost over the bent
   World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.",Gerard Manley Hopkins,sonnet

With thee; but, sir, so what I plead is just. 
Why do sinners’ ways prosper? and why must 
Disappointment all I endeavour end?

How wouldst thou worse, I wonder, than thou dost 
Defeat, thwart me? Oh, the sots and thralls of lust 
Do in spare hours more thrive than I that spend, 
Sir, life upon thy cause. See, banks and brakes

As Kingfishers Catch Fire,"As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame; 
As tumbled over rim in roundy wells 
Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's 
Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name; 
Each mortal thing does one thing and the same: 
Deals out that being indoors each one dwells; 
Selves — goes itself; myself it speaks and spells, 
Crying Whát I dó is me: for that I came. 
 
I say móre: the just man justices; 
Keeps grace: thát keeps all his goings graces; 
Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is — 
Chríst — for Christ plays in ten thousand places, 
Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his

The Caged Skylark,"As a dare-gale skylark scanted in a dull cage,

This in drudgery, day-labouring-out life's age. 
Though aloft on turf or perch or poor low stage 
    Both sing sometímes the sweetest, sweetest spells, 
    Yet both droop deadly sómetimes in their cells 
Or wring their barriers in bursts of fear or rage. 
 
Not that the sweet-fowl, song-fowl, needs no rest — 
Why, hear him, hear him babble & drop down to his nest, 
    But his own nest, wild nest, no prison. 
Man's spirit will be flesh-bound, when found at best, 
But uncumberèd: meadow-down is not distressed

Carrion Comfort,"Not, I'll not, carrion comfort, Despair, not feast on thee; 
Not untwist — slack they may be — these last strands of man 
In me ór, most weary, cry I can no more. I can; 
Can something, hope, wish day come, not choose not to be. 
But ah, but O thou terrible, why wouldst thou rude on me 
Thy wring-world right foot rock? lay a lionlimb against me? scan 
With darksome devouring eyes my bruisèd bones? and fan, 
O in turns of tempest, me heaped there; me frantic to avoid thee and flee? 
 
   Why? That my chaff might fly; my grain lie, sheer and clear. 
Nay in all that toil, that coil, since (seems) I kissed the rod, 
Hand rather, my heart lo! lapped strength, stole joy, would laugh, chéer.

In the Valley of the Elwy,"I remember a house where all were good

Fetched fresh, as I suppose, off some sweet wood. 
That cordial air made those kind people a hood

   Will, or mild nights the new morsels of Spring: 
Why, it seemed of course; seemed of right it should. 
 
Lovely the woods, waters, meadows, combes, vales, 
All the air things wear that build this world of Wales;

With richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.

Last Hope,"Beside a humble stone, a tree
 Floats in the cemetery’s air,
 Not planted in memoriam there,
 But growing wild, uncultured, free.
  
 A bird comes perching there to sing,
 Winter and summer, proffering
 Its faithful song—sad, bittersweet.
 That tree, that bird are you and I:
  
 You, memory; absence, me, that tide
 And time record. Ah, by your side
 To live again, undying! Aye,
  
 To live again! But ma petite,
 Now nothingness, cold, owns my flesh. . .
 Will your love keep my memory fresh?",Paul Verlaine,sonnet
To a Daisy,"Slight as thou art, thou art enough to hide, 
Like all created things, secrets from me, 
And stand a barrier to eternity. 
And I, how can I praise thee well and wide 

From where I dwell—upon the hither side? 
Thou little veil for so great mystery, 
When shall I penetrate all things and thee, 
And then look back? For this I must abide, 

Till thou shalt grow and fold and be unfurled 
Literally between me and the world. 
Then shall I drink from in beneath a spring, 

And from a poet’s side shall read his book. 
O daisy mine, what will it be to look 
From God’s side even of such a simple thing? ",Alice Meynell,sonnet
City Visions,"
                                           I.

As the blind Milton’s memory of light,
The deaf Beethoven’s phantasy of tone,
Wrought joys for them surpassing all things known
In our restricted sphere of sound and sight,—
So while the glaring streets of brick and stone
Vex with heat, noise, and dust from morn till night,
I will give rein to Fancy, taking flight
From dismal now and here, and dwell alone
With new-enfranchised senses. All day long,
Think ye ’t is I, who sit ’twixt darkened walls,
While ye chase beauty over land and sea?
Uplift on wings of some rare poet’s song,
Where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls,
I soar cloud-high, free as the winds are free.

                                           II.

Who grasps the substance? who ’mid shadows strays?
He who within some dark-bright wood reclines,
’Twixt sleep and waking, where the needled pines
Have cushioned all his couch with soft brown sprays?
He notes not how the living water shines,
Trembling along the cliff, a flickering haze,
Brimming a wine-bright pool, nor lifts his gaze
To read the ancient wonders and the signs.
Does he possess the actual, or do I,
Who paint on air more than his sense receives,
The glittering pine-tufts with closed eyes behold,
Breathe the strong resinous perfume, see the sky
Quiver like azure flame between the leaves,
And open unseen gates with key of gold?

Chopin,"I

A dream of interlinking hands, of feet 
Tireless to spin the unseen, fairy woof 
Of the entangling waltz. Bright eyebeams meet, 
Gay laughter echoes from the vaulted roof. 
Warm perfumes rise; the soft unflickering glow 
Of branching lights sets off the changeful charms 
Of glancing gems, rich stuffs, the dazzling snow 
Of necks unkerchieft, and bare, clinging arms. 
Hark to the music! How beneath the strain 
Of reckless revelry, vibrates and sobs 
One fundamental chord of constant pain, 
The pulse-beat of the poet's heart that throbs. 
So yearns, though all the dancing waves rejoice, 
The troubled sea's disconsolate, deep voice. 

 

II

Who shall proclaim the golden fable false 
Of Orpheus' miracles? This subtle strain 
Above our prose-world's sordid loss and gain 
Lightly uplifts us. With the rhythmic waltz, 
The lyric prelude, the nocturnal song 
Of love and languor, varied visions rise, 
That melt and blend to our enchanted eyes. 
The Polish poet who sleeps silenced long, 
The seraph-souled musician, breathes again 
Eternal eloquence, immortal pain. 
Revived the exalted face we know so well, 
The illuminated eyes, the fragile frame, 
Slowly consuming with its inward flame, 
We stir not, speak not, lest we break the spell. 

 

III

A voice was needed, sweet and true and fine 
As the sad spirit of the evening breeze, 
Throbbing with human passion, yet devine 
As the wild bird's untutored melodies. 
A voice for him 'neath twilight heavens dim, 
Who mourneth for his dead, while round him fall 
The wan and noiseless leaves. A voice for him 
Who sees the first green sprout, who hears the call 
Of the first robin on the first spring day. 
A voice for all whom Fate hath set apart, 
Who, still misprized, must perish by the way, 
Longing with love, for that they lack the art 
Of their own soul's expression. For all these 
Sing the unspoken hope, the vague, sad reveries.

Twanging the full-stringed lyre through all its scope.

Of conflict bids us with our quest to part.
We see adown the distance, rainbow-arched,

The ages of soul-struggle sterner? Through
The flinty stone, O image of despair,

The New Colossus,"Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

Prince, priest, and people, spurned by zealot hate.
Hounded from sea to sea, from state to state, 
The West refused them, and the East abhorred. 
No anchorage the known world could afford, 
Close-locked was every port, barred every gate. 
Then smiling, thou unveil’dst, O two-faced year,

Grim bulwarked hatred between heart and heart!""",Emma Lazarus,sonnet
Long Island Sound,"I see it as it looked one afternoon 
In August,— by a fresh soft breeze o’erblown. 
The swiftness of the tide, the light thereon, 
A far-off sail, white as a crescent moon. 
The shining waters with pale currents strewn, 
The quiet fishing-smacks, the Eastern cove, 
The semi-circle of its dark, green grove. 
The luminous grasses, and the merry sun 
In the grave sky; the sparkle far and wide, 
Laughter of unseen children, cheerful chirp 
Of crickets, and low lisp of rippling tide, 
Light summer clouds fantastical as sleep  
Changing unnoted while I gazed thereon.

For May is here once more, and so is he,—
His dusty trousers, rolled half to the knee,
And his bare ankles grimy, too, as they:
Cross-hatchings of the nettle, in array
Of feverish stripes, hint vividly to me
Of woody pathways winding endlessly
Along the creek, where even yesterday
He plunged his shrinking body—gasped and shook—
Yet called the water ""warm,"" with never lack
Of joy. And so, half enviously I look
Upon this graceless barefoot and his track,—
His toe stubbed—ay, his big toe-nail knocked back
Like unto the clasp of an old pocketbook.",James Whitcomb Riley,sonnet

By artists builded and by genius planned. 
Beyond the reach of the apprentice hand, 
   Beyond the ken of the unturtored heart, 
   Like a fine carving in a common mart, 
Only the favored few will understand. 
A chef-d’oeuvre toiled over with great care,

No cemetery engulph me — no lone grot,

It pays its last sad melancholy debt 
To some outjourneying pilgrim. May my lot 
Be rather to lie in some much-used spot, 
Where human life, with all its noise and fret, 
Throbs on about me. Let the roll of wheels, 
With all earth’s sounds of pleasure, commerce, love, 
And rush of hurrying feet surge o’er my head.

Self-Mastery,"To catch the spirit in its wayward flight

And still more futile, ay, we e’en must deem

Its restless wanderings, – to lure it back 
To shoals of calm. Full many a moan and sigh

Oft uttered, clung to – when of strength the lack 
Seems direst – brings the answer to our cry: 
A gift from Him who lifts our ev’ry care.",Henrietta Cordelia Ray,sonnet

To fan a lover’s brow; the waves to sing 
Have quite forgotten till the deep shall fling 
A bow across its vibrant chords. Then, lest 
One moment of the sea’s repose we lose, 
Nor furnish Fancy with a thousand themes 
Of unimagined sweetness, let us gaze 
On this serenity, for as we muse, 
Lo! all is restless motion: life’s best dreams 
Give changing moods to even halcyon days.",Henrietta Cordelia Ray,sonnet
Toussaint L’Ouverture,"To those fair isles where crimson sunsets burn, 
We send a backward glance to gaze on thee, 
Brave Toussaint! thou was surely born to be 
A hero; thy proud spirit could but spurn  
Each outrage on the race. Couldst thou unlearn 
The lessons taught by instinct? Nay! and we 
Who share the zeal that would make all men free, 
Must e’en with pride unto thy life-work turn. 
Soul-dignity was thine and purest aim; 
And ah! how sad that thou wast left to mourn 
In chains ’neath alien skies. On him, shame! shame! 
That mighty conqueror who dared to claim 
The right to bind thee. Him we heap with scorn, 
And noble patriot! guard with love thy name.",Henrietta Cordelia Ray,sonnet
Impression du Voyage,"The sea was sapphire coloured, and the sky
    Burned like a heated opal through air,
    We hoisted sail; the wind was blowing fair
For the blue lands that to the eastward lie.
From the steep prow I marked with quickening eye
    Zakynthos, every olive grove and creek,
    Ithaca’s cliff, Lycaon’s snowy peak,
And all the flower-strewn hills of Arcady.
The flapping of the sail against the mast,
    The ripple of the water on the side,
    The ripple of girls’ laughter at the stern,
The only sounds:—when ’gan the West to burn,
    And a red sun upon the seas to ride,
    I stood upon the soil of Greece at last!",Oscar Wilde,sonnet
The New Remorse,"The sin was mine; I did not understand. 
        So now is music prisoned in her cave, 
        Save where some ebbing desultory wave 
Frets with its restless whirls this meagre strand. 
And in the withered hollow of this land 
        Hath Summer dug herself so deep a grave, 
        That hardly can the leaden willow crave 
One silver blossom from keen Winter’s hand. 
But who is this who cometh by the shore? 
(Nay, love, look up and wonder!) Who is this 
        Who cometh in dyed garments from the South? 
It is thy new-found Lord, and he shall kiss 
        The yet unravished roses of thy mouth, 
And I shall weep and worship, as before.",Oscar Wilde,sonnet
On the Sale By Auction of Keats' Love Letters,"These are the letters which Endymion wrote
    To one he loved in secret, and apart.
    And now the brawlers of the auction mart
Bargain and bid for each poor blotted note,
Ay! for each separate pulse of passion quote
    The merchant’s price. I think they love not art
    Who break the crystal of a poet’s heart
That small and sickly eyes may glare and gloat.

Is it not said that many years ago,
    In a far Eastern town, some soldiers ran
    With torches through the midnight, and began
To wrangel for mean raiment, and to throw
    Dice for the garments of a wretched man,
Not knowing the God’s wonder, or His woe?",Oscar Wilde,sonnet
Sonnet to Liberty,"Not that I love thy children, whose dull eyes
See nothing save their own unlovely woe,
Whose minds know nothing, nothing care to know,—
But that the roar of thy Democracies,
Thy reigns of Terror, thy great Anarchies,
Mirror my wildest passions like the sea,—
And give my rage a brother——! Liberty!
For this sake only do thy dissonant cries
Delight my discreet soul, else might all kings
By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades
Rob nations of their rights inviolate
And I remain unmoved—and yet, and yet,
These Christs that die upon the barricades,
God knows it I am with them, in some things.",Oscar Wilde,sonnet
Reserve,"You that are dear, O you above the rest! 
Forgive him his evasive moods and cold; 
The absence that belied him oft of old, 
The war upon sad speech, the desperate jest, 
And pity’s wildest gush but half-confessed, 
Forgive him! Let your gentle memories hold 
Some written word once tender and once bold, 
Or service done shamefacedly at best, 
Whereby to judge him. All his days he spent, 
Like one who with an angel wrestled well, 
O’ermastering Love with show of light disdain; 
And whatso’er your spirits underwent, 
He, wounded for you, worked no miracle 
To make his heart’s allegiance wholly plain.",Louise Imogen Guiney,sonnet
A Salutation,"High-hearted Surrey! I do love your ways, 
Venturous, frank, romantic, vehement, 
All with inviolate honor sealed and blent, 
To the axe-edge that cleft your soldier-bays: 
I love your youth, your friendships, whims, and frays; 
Your strict, sweet verse, with its imperious bent, 
Heard as in dreams from some old harper’s tent, 
And stirring in the listener’s brain for days. 
Good father-poet! if to-night there be 
At Framlingham none save the north-wind’s sighs, 
No guard but moonlight’s crossed and trailing spears, 
Smile yet upon the pilgrim named like me, 
Close at your gates, whose fond and weary eyes 
Sought not one other down three hundred years!",Louise Imogen Guiney,sonnet
At a Symphony,"Oh, I would have these tongues oracular 
Dip into silence, tease no more, let be! 
They madden, like some choral of the free 
Gusty and sweet against a prison-bar. 
To earth the boast that her gold empires are, 
The menace of delicious death to me, 
Great Undesign, strong as by God’s decree, 
Piercing the heart with beauty from afar! 
Music too winning to the sense forlorn! 
Of what angelic lineage was she born, 
Bred in what rapture?—These her sires and friends: 
Censure, Denial, Gloom, and Hunger’s throe. 
Praised be the Spirit that thro’ thee, Schubert! so 
Wrests evil unto wholly heavenly ends.",Louise Imogen Guiney,sonnet
Fog,"Like bodiless water passing in a sigh, 
Thro’ palsied streets the fatal shadows flow, 
And in their sharp disastrous undertow 
Suck in the morning sun, and all the sky. 
The towery vista sinks upon the eye, 
As if it heard the Hebrew bugles blow, 
Black and dissolved; nor could the founders know 
How what was built so bright should daily die. 
 
Thy mood with man’s is broken and blent in, 
City of Stains! And ache of thought doth drown 
The primitive light in which thy life began; 
Great as thy dole is, smirchèd with his sin, 
Greater and elder yet the love of man 
Full in thy look, tho’ the dark visor’s down.",Louise Imogen Guiney,sonnet
Strikers in Hyde Park,"A woof reversed the fatal shuttles weave, 
How slow! but never once they slip the thread. 
Hither, upon the Georgian idler’s tread, 
Up spacious ways the lindens interleave, 
Clouding the royal air since yester-eve, 
Come men bereft of time and scant of bread, 
Loud, who were dumb, immortal, who were dead, 
Thro’ the cowed world their kingdom to retrieve. 
 
What ails thee, England? Altar, mart, and grange 
Dream of the knife by night; not so, not so 
The clear Republic waits the general throe, 
Along her noonday mountains’ open range. 
God be with both! for one is young to know 
The other’s rote of evil and of change.",Louise Imogen Guiney,sonnet
The Lights of London,"The evenfall, so slow on hills, hath shot 
Far down into the valley’s cold extreme, 
Untimely midnight; spire and roof and stream 
Like fleeing specters, shudder and are not. 
The Hampstead hollies, from their sylvan plot 
Yet cloudless, lean to watch as in a dream, 
From chaos climb with many a sudden gleam, 
London, one moment fallen and forgot. 
 
Her booths begin to flare; and gases bright 
Prick door and window; all her streets obscure 
Sparkle and swarm with nothing true nor sure, 
Full as a marsh of mist and winking light; 
Heaven thickens over, Heaven that cannot cure 
Her tear by day, her fevered smile by night.",Louise Imogen Guiney,sonnet
In the Reading-Room of the British Museum,"Praised be the moon of books! that doth above 
A world of men, the fallen Past behold, 
And fill the spaces else so void and cold 
To make a very heaven again thereof; 
As when the sun is set behind a grove, 
And faintly unto nether ether rolled, 
All night his whiter image and his mould 
Grows beautiful with looking on her love. 
 
Thou therefore, moon of so divine a ray, 
Lend to our steps both fortitude and light! 
Feebly along a venerable way 
They climb the infinite, or perish quite; 
Nothing are days and deeds to such as they, 
While in this liberal house thy face is bright.",Louise Imogen Guiney,sonnet
Sunday Chimes in the City,"Across the bridge, where in the morning blow 
The wrinkled tide turns homeward, and is fain 
Homeward to drag the black sea-goer’s chain, 
And the long yards by Dowgate dipping low; 
Across dispeopled ways, patient and slow, 
Saint Magnus and Saint Dunstan call in vain: 
From Wren’s forgotten belfries, in the rain, 
Down the blank wharves the dropping octaves go. 
 
Forbid not these! Tho’ no man heed, they shower 
A subtle beauty on the empty hour, 
From all their dark throats aching and outblown; 
Aye in the prayerless places welcome most, 
Like the last gull that up a naked coast 
Deploys her white and steady wing, alone.",Louise Imogen Guiney,sonnet
Despotisms,"I: THE MOTOR: 1905

From hedgerows where aromas fain would be
    New volleyed odours execrably arise;
    The flocks, with hell-smoke in their patient eyes,
Into the ditch from bawling ruin flee:
Spindrift of one abominated sea
    Along all roads in wrecking fury flies
    Till on young strangled leaf, on bloom that dies,
In this far plot it writes a rune for me.

Vast intimate tyranny! Nature dispossessed
    Helplessly hates thee, whose symbolic flare
Lights up (with what reiterance unblest!)
    Entrails of horror in a world thought fair.
False God of pastime thou, vampire of rest,
    Augur of what pollution, what despair?",Louise Imogen Guiney,sonnet
"Sonnet XLIV [For Thee the Sun Doth Daily Rise, and Set] ","For thee the sun doth daily rise, and set 
Behind the curtain of the hills of sleep,  
And my soul, passing through the nether deep,  
Broods on thy love, and never can forget.  
For thee the garlands of the wood are wet,  
For thee the daisies up the meadow’s sweep 
Stir in the sidelong light, and for thee weep 
The drooping ferns above the violet.  
For thee the labour of my studious ease 
I ply with hope, for thee all pleasures please,  
Thy sweetness doth the bread of sorrow leaven;  
And from thy noble lips and heart of gold 
I drink the comfort of the faiths of old,  
Any thy perfection is my proof of heaven.",George Santayana,sonnet
A Sonnet on Cervantes,"In all my days of troubled loneliness
And fretted grief Cervantes is to me
A faithful friend, and none so true as he,
That brings me precious gifts of quietness.

All nature his, and life. Of his largesse
My dreams, that are knight-errants bold and free,
Have golden casques to crown them gloriously.
He is, for me: sigh, prayer, joyousness.

He speaks as runs a brook, so amorous
And very gentle is this Christian knight,
Ever undaunted. And I love him thus,

Beholding how the world, by fate’s design,
Reaps, from his deathless sorrow, rich delight,
And laughter from a madness so divine!

 

Soneto a Cervantes

Horas de pesadumbre y de tristeza
paso en mi soledad. Pero Cervantes
es buen amigo. Endulza mis instantes
ásperos, y reposa mi cabeza.

El es la vida y la naturaleza;
regala un yelmo de oro y de diamantes
a mis sueños errantes.
Es para mí: suspire, ríe y reza.

Cristiano y amoroso caballero
parla como un arroyo cristalino.
¡Así le admiro y quiero,

viendo cómo el destino
hace que regocije al mundo entero
la tristeza inmortal de ser divino!",Rubén Darío,sonnet
Slow through the Dark,"Slow moves the pageant of a climbing race; 
   Their footsteps drag far, far below the height, 
   And, unprevailing by their utmost might, 
Seem faltering downward from each hard won place. 
No strange, swift-sprung exception we; we trace 
   A devious way thro’ dim, uncertain light,— 
   Our hope, through the long vistaed years, a sight 
Of that our Captain’s soul sees face to face. 

   Who, faithless, faltering that the road is steep, 
Now raiseth up his drear insistent cry? 
   Who stoppeth here to spend a while in sleep 
Or curseth that the storm obscures the sky? 
   Heed not the darkness round you, dull and deep; 
The clouds grow thickest when the summit’s nigh.",Paul Laurence Dunbar,sonnet
Unsolved,"Amid my books I lived the hurrying years,
   Disdaining kinship with my fellow man;
Alike to me were human smiles and tears,
   I cared not whither Earth's great life-stream ran,
Till as I knelt before my mouldered shrine,
   God made me look into a woman's eyes;
And I, who thought all earthly wisdom mine,
   Knew in a moment that the eternal skies
Were measured but in inches, to the quest
   That lay before me in that mystic gaze.
“Surely I have been errant; it is best
   That I should tread, with men their human ways.”
God took the teacher, ere the task was learned,
And to my lonely books again I turned.",John McCrae,sonnet
Electrocution,"He shudders—feeling on the shaven spot
The probing wind, that stabs him to a thought
Of storm-drenched fields in a white foam of light,
And roads of his hill-town that leap to sight
Like threads of tortured silver. . .while the guards—
Monstrous deft dolls that move as on a string,
In wonted haste to finish with this thing,
Turn faces blanker than asphalted yards.

They heard the shriek that tore out of its sheath
But as a feeble moan. . .yet dared not breathe,
Who stared there at him, arching—like a tree
When the winds wrench it and the earth holds tight—
Whose soul, expanding in white agony,
Had fused in flaming circuit with the night.",Lola Ridge,sonnet
Listening,"’T is you that are the music, not your song.
  The song is but a door which, opening wide,
  Lets forth the pent-up melody inside,
Your spirit’s harmony, which clear and strong
Sing but of you. Throughout your whole life long
  Your songs, your thoughts, your doings, each divide
  This perfect beauty; waves within a tide,
Or single notes amid a glorious throng.
  The song of earth has many different chords;
Ocean has many moods and many tones
  Yet always ocean. In the damp Spring woods
The painted trillium smiles, while crisp pine cones
  Autumn alone can ripen. So is this
  One music with a thousand cadences.",Amy Lowell,sonnet
Leisure,"Leisure, thou goddess of a bygone age,
   When hours were long and days sufficed to hold
    Wide-eyed delights and pleasures uncontrolled
By shortening moments, when no gaunt presage
Of undone duties, modern heritage,
    Haunted our happy minds; must thou withhold
    Thy presence from this over-busy world,
And bearing silence with thee disengage
    Our twined fortunes? Deeps of unhewn woods
    Alone can cherish thee, alone possess
Thy quiet, teeming vigor. This our crime:
    Not to have worshipped, marred by alien moods
    That sole condition of all loveliness,
The dreaming lapse of slow, unmeasured time.",Amy Lowell,sonnet
To The Times Editorials,"Lovely Antiques, breathing in every line
The perfume of an age long passed away,
Wafting us back to 1829,
Museum pieces of a by-gone day,
You should not languish in the public press
Where modern thought might reach and do you harm,
And vulgar youth insult your hoariness,
Missing the flavor of your old world charm;
You should be locked, where rust cannot corrode
In some old rosewood cabinet, dimmed by age,
With silver-lustre, tortoise shell and Spode;
And all would cry, who read your yellowing page:
            “Yes, that’s the sort of thing that men believed
            Before the First Reform Bill was conceived!”",Alice Duer Miller,sonnet
A Dream Pang,"I had withdrawn in forest, and my song
Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway;
And to the forest edge you came one day
(This was my dream) and looked and pondered long,
But did not enter, though the wish was strong: 
You shook your pensive head as who should say,
‘I dare not—too far in his footsteps stray—
He must seek me would he undo the wrong.’

Not far, but near, I stood and saw it all
Behind low boughs the trees let down outside;
And the sweet pang it cost me not to call
And tell you that I saw does still abide.
But ’tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof,
For the wood wakes, and you are here for proof.",Robert Frost,sonnet
Putting in the Seed,"You come to fetch me from my work to-night 
When supper's on the table, and we'll see 
If I can leave off burying the white 
Soft petals fallen from the apple tree. 
(Soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite, 
Mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea;) 
And go along with you ere you lose sight 
Of what you came for and become like me, 
Slave to a springtime passion for the earth. 
How Love burns through the Putting in the Seed 
On through the watching for that early birth 
When, just as the soil tarnishes with weed, 
The sturdy seedling with arched body comes 
Shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs.",Robert Frost,sonnet
Be Still. The Hanging Gardens were a Dream,"Be still. The Hanging Gardens were a dream
That over Persian roses flew to kiss
The curlèd lashes of Semiramis.
Troy never was, nor green Skamander stream.
Provence and Troubadour are merest lies
The glorious hair of Venice was a beam
Made within Titian’s eye. The sunsets seem,
The world is very old and nothing is.
Be still. Thou foolish thing, thou canst not wake,
Nor thy tears wedge thy soldered lids apart,
But patter in the darkness of thy heart.
Thy brain is plagued. Thou art a frighted owl
Blind with the light of life thou ’ldst not forsake,
And Error loves and nourishes thy soul.",Trumbull Stickney,sonnet
Live Blindly and upon the Hour,"Live blindly and upon the hour. The Lord, 
Who was the Future, died full long ago. 
Knowledge which is the Past is folly. Go, 
Poor child, and be not to thyself abhorred. 
Around thine earth sun-wingèd winds do blow 
And planets roll; a meteor draws his sword; 
The rainbow breaks his seven-coloured chord 
And the long strips of river-silver flow: 
Awake! Give thyself to the lovely hours. 
Drinking their lips, catch thou the dream in flight 
About their fragile hairs’ aërial gold. 
Thou art divine, thou livest,—as of old 
Apollo springing naked to the light, 
And all his island shivered into flowers.",Trumbull Stickney,sonnet
Tho’ Lack of Laurels and of Wreaths Not One,"Tho’ lack of laurels and of wreaths not one

To win the guerdon which is never won.
Witness, a purpose never is undone.
And tho’ fate drain our seas of violet
To gather round our lives her wide-hung net,
Memories of hopes that are not shall atone.
Not wholly starless is the ill-starred life,
Not all is night in failure, and the shield
Sometimes well grasped, tho’ shattered in the strife.
And here while all the lowering heaven is ringed
With our loud death-shouts echoed, on the field
Stands forth our Nikè, proud, tho’ broken-winged.",Trumbull Stickney,sonnet
"You Say, Columbus with his Argosies","You say, Columbus with his argosies 
Who rash and greedy took the screaming main 
And vanished out before the hurricane 
Into the sunset after merchandise, 
Then under western palms with simple eyes 
Trafficked and robbed and triumphed home again: 
You say this is the glory of the brain 
And human life no other use than this? 
I then do answering say to you: The line 
Of wizards and of saviours, keeping trust 
In that which made them pensive and divine, 
Passes before us like a cloud of dust. 
What were they? Actors, ill and mad with wine, 
And all their language babble and disgust.",Trumbull Stickney,sonnet
I Used to Think,"I used to think 
The mind essential in the body, even 
As stood the body essential in the mind: 
Two inseparable things, by nature equal 
And similar, and in creation’s song 
Halving the total scale: it is not so. 
Unlike and cross like driftwood sticks they come 
Churned in the giddy trough: a chunk of pine, 
A slab of rosewood: mangled each on each 
With knocks and friction, or in deadly pain 
Sheathing each other’s splinters: till at last 
Without all stuff or shape they ’re jetted up

Was vomited in horror from the sea.",Trumbull Stickney,sonnet
Near Helikon,"By such an all-embalming summer day 
As sweetens now among the mountain pines 
Down to the cornland yonder and the vines, 
To where the sky and sea are mixed in gray, 
How do all things together take their way 
Harmonious to the harvest, bringing wines 
And bread and light and whatsoe’er combines 
In the large wreath to make it round and gay. 
To me my troubled life doth now appear 
Like scarce distinguishable summits hung 
Around the blue horizon: places where 
Not even a traveller purposeth to steer,— 
Whereof a migrant bird in passing sung, 
And the girl closed her window not to hear.",Trumbull Stickney,sonnet
A Fixed Idea,"What torture lurks within a single thought
When grown too constant; and however kind,
However welcome still, the weary mind
Aches with its presence. Dull remembrance taught
Remembers on unceasingly; unsought
The old delight is with us but to find
That all recurring joy is pain refined,
Become a habit, and we struggle, caught.
You lie upon my heart as on a nest,
Folded in peace, for you can never know
How crushed I am with having you at rest
Heavy upon my life. I love you so
You bind my freedom from its rightful quest.
In mercy lift your drooping wings and go.",Amy Lowell,sonnet
The Matrix,"Goaded and harassed in the factory
   That tears our life up into bits of days

Shredding our portion of Eternity,
We break away at last, and steal the key

   Of space unroll, and Heaven overlays
The leafy, sun-lit earth of Fantasy.
   Beyond the ilex shadow glares the sun,
   Scorching against the blue flame of the sky.
Brown lily-pads lie heavy and supine
   Within a granite basin, under one
   The bronze-gold glimmer of a carp; and I
Reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine.",Amy Lowell,sonnet

To the Negro Farmers of the United States,"God washes clean the souls and hearts of you,
His favored ones, whose backs bend o’er the soil,
Which grudging gives to them requite for toil
In sober graces and in vision true.
God places in your hands the pow’r to do
A service sweet. Your gift supreme to foil
The bare-fanged wolves of hunger in the moil
Of Life’s activities. Yet all too few
Your glorious band, clean sprung from Nature’s heart;
The hope of hungry thousands, in whose breast
Dwells fear that you should fail. God placed no dart
Of war within your hands, but pow’r to start
Tears, praise, love, joy, enwoven in a crest
To crown you glorious, brave ones of the soil.",Alice Dunbar-Nelson,sonnet
Written After Reading King Lear,"Long is his course, O master of our woes,
And joys, and tears, our passions and desires,
In nature’s school—in hell-begotten fires;
Dread is the agony and fell the throes
Which with the Night and Storm he undergoes,
While Treason in his robes herself attires, 
And Love beneath adultery’s sheet expires,
And mocked Sincerity sincerer grows.
To vie with wailing winds and weeping clouds
And valleys shrieking in the fangs of storms, 
This Human Hurricane thou didst create;
But just as soon as Death this horror shrouds,
I hear the distant cry of fiery forms, 
Ay, and the creaking of hell’s deepest gate.",Ameen Rihani,sonnet
To The Sonnet,"Though cribbed and gyved, thou canst within thy

Unfold a wondrous wealth of worlds unseen, 
And flood the soul’s abyss with moon-light sheen,
As well as darken passions’ gilded halls ; 
Thy fourteen outlets are so many falls 
From which gush out the prisoned joy, or 
         spleen— 
The silvery cascades, or the billows green,
And either a sea of bliss or grief recalls. 
Thou goddess of the gems of Fancy’s deep, 
Though few thy facets, they reflect the whole 
Of inner-self in multi-shaded hues ; 
Thou art the couch of dreams that never sleep ; 
Thou art the phoenix of the poet’s soul,
As well the crystal palace of his muse.",Ameen Rihani,sonnet
"October XXIX, 1795 ","Time sitting on the throne of Memory
Bade all her subject Days, the past had known
Arise and say what thing gave them renown
Unforgetable, ‘Rising from the sea,
I gave the Genoese his dream to be;’
‘I saw the Corsican’s Guards swept down;’
‘Colonies I made free from a tyrant’s crown;’—
So each Day told its immortality.

And with these blazing triumphs spoke one voice
Whose wistful speech no vaunting did employ:

I only know he made man’s heart rejoice
Because he played with Beauty for a toy!’",William Stanley Braithwaite,sonnet
The Eyes of My Regret,"Always at dusk, the same tearless experience, 
The same dragging of feet up the same well-worn path 
To the same well-worn rock; 
The same crimson or gold dropping away of the sun 
The same tints—rose, saffron, violet, lavender, grey 
Meeting, mingling, mixing mistily; 
Before me the same blue black cedar rising jaggedly to a point; 
Over it, the same slow unlidding of twin stars, 
Two eyes, unfathomable, soul-searing, 
Watching, watching—watching me; 
The same two eyes that draw me forth, against my will dusk after dusk; 
The same two eyes that keep me sitting late into the night, chin on knees 
Keep me there lonely, rigid, tearless, numbly miserable,

Chaucer,"Gone are the sensuous stars, and manifold,
Clear sunbeams burst upon the front of night;
Ten thousand swords of azure and of gold
Give darkness to the dark and welcome light;
Across the night of ages strike the gleams,
And leading on the gilded host appears
An old man writing in a book of dreams,
And telling tales of lovers for the years;
Still Troilus hears a voice that whispers, Stay;
In Nature’s garden what a mad rout sings!
Let’s hear these motley pilgrims wile away
The tedious hours with stories of old things;
Or might some shining eagle claim
These lowly numbers for the House of Fame!",Benjamin Brawley,sonnet
The Dream,"I dreamt—before death made such dreaming vain—
That sometime, on a day of wind and rain,
I would come home to you at fall of night
And see your window flushed with firelight.
There in the chill dark lonesomeness I’d wait
A moment, standing at the garden gate
Scarce trusting that my happiness was true,—
The kind warm lights of home and love and you.

Then, lest they’d vanish to be mine no more,
I’d speed my steps along the garden path,
Cross my own threshold, close the wind-blown door
And find you in the firelight of the hearth.
O happiness! to kneel beside you there
And feel your fingers resting on my hair.",Winifred M. Letts,sonnet
Loss,"In losing you I lost my sun and moon
And all the stars that blessed my lonely night.
I lost the hope of Spring, the joy of June,
The Autumn’s peace, the Winter’s firelight.
I lost the zest of living, the sweet sense
Expectant of your step, your smile, your kiss;
I lost all hope and fear and keen suspense
For this cold calm, sans agony, sans bliss.
I lost the rainbow’s gold, the silver key
That gave me freedom of my town of dreams;
I lost the path that leads to Faërie
By beechen glades and heron-haunted streams.
I lost the master word, dear love, the clue
That threads the maze of life when I lost you.",Winifred M. Letts,sonnet
Dead,"In misty cerements they wrapped the word
My heart had feared so long: dead... dead... I heard
But marvelled they could think the thing was true
Because death cannot be for such as you.
So while they spoke kind words to suit my need
Of foolish idle things my heart took heed,
Your racquet and worn-out tennis shoe,
Your pipe upon the mantel,—then a bird
Upon the wind-tossed larch began to sing
And I remembered how one day in Spring
You found the wren’s nest in the wall and said
“Hush!... listen! I can hear them quarrelling...”
The tennis court is marked, the wrens are fled,
But you are dead, beloved, you are dead",Winifred M. Letts,sonnet
Substitution,"Is Life itself but many ways of thought, 
Does thinking furl the poets’ pleiades, 
Is in His slightest convolution wrought 
These mantled worlds and their men-freighted seas? 
He thinks—and being comes to ardent things: 
The splendor of the day-spent sun, love’s birth,— 
Or dreams a little, while creation swings 
The circle of His mind and Time’s full girth . . . 
As here within this noisy peopled room 
My thought leans forward . . . quick! you’re lifted clear 
Of brick and frame to moonlit garden bloom,— 
Absurdly easy, now, our walking, dear, 
Talking, my leaning close to touch your face . . .

Verses to the Moon,"Oh moon, who now look over the roof
of the church, in the tropical calm
to be saluted by him who has been out all night,
to be barked at by the dogs of the suburbs,

Oh moon who in your silence have laughed at
all things! In your sidereal silence 
when, keeping carefully in the shadow, the
municipal judge steals from some den.

But you offer, saturnine traveler,
with what eloquence in mute space
consolation to him whose life is broken,

while there sing to you from a drunken brawl
long-haired, neurasthenic bards,
and lousy creatures who play dominos.

 

 

 

¡Oh, luna, que hoy te asomas al tejado
de la iglesia, en la calma tropical,
para que te salude un trasnochado
y te ladren los perros de arrabal!

¡Oh, luna! . . . ¡En tu silencio te has burlado
de todo! . . . En tu silencio sideral,
viste anoche robar en despoblado
. . . ¡y el ladrón era un Juez municipal!

Mas tú ofreces, viajera saturnina,
con qué elocuencia en los espacios mudos,
consuelo al que la vida laceró,

mientras te cantan, en cualquier cantina,
neurasténicos bardos melenudos
y piojosos, que juegan dominó. . .",Luis Carlos López,sonnet
To E,"The door was opened and I saw you there
And for the first time heard you speak my name.
Then like the sun your sweetness overcame
My shy and shadowy mood; I was aware
That joy was hidden in your happy hair,
And that for you love held no hint of shame;
My eyes caught light from yours, within whose flame
Humor and passion have an equal share.

How many times since then have I not seen
Your great eyes widen when you talk of love,
And darken slowly with a fair desire;
How many times since then your soul has been
Clear to my gaze as curving skies above,
Wearing like them a raiment made of fire.

Wild Peaches,"                                1 

When the world turns completely upside down
You say we’ll emigrate to the Eastern Shore
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;
We’ll live among wild peach trees, miles from town,
You’ll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown
Homespun, dyed butternut’s dark gold color.
Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,
We’ll swim in milk and honey till we drown.

The winter will be short, the summer long,
The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;
All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall
Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.


                                  2 

The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.
The misted early mornings will be cold;
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.
The sun, which burns from copper into brass,
Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.

Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;
The spring begins before the winter’s over.
By February you may find the skins
Of garter snakes and water moccasins
Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.


                                  3 

When April pours the colors of a shell
Upon the hills, when every little creek
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake
In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,
When strawberries go begging, and the sleek
Blue plums lie open to the blackbird’s beak,
We shall live well — we shall live very well.

The months between the cherries and the peaches
Are brimming cornucopias which spill
Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;
Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches
We’ll trample bright persimmons, while you kill
Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.


                                  4 

Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones
There’s something in this richness that I hate.
I love the look, austere, immaculate,
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.
There’s something in my very blood that owns
Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,
A thread of water, churned to milky spate
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.

I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,
Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;
That spring, briefer than apple-blossom’s breath,
Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,
Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,
And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.",Elinor Wylie,sonnet
The Soldier,"If I should die, think only this of me:
   That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England.  There shall be
   In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
   Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
A body of England's, breathing English air,
   Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
   A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
     Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
   And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
     In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.",Rupert Brooke,sonnet

He fails the world but you he did not fail,
He led you through all forms of grief and strife

That coils in one’s own brain against your calm,
That great rich jewel well guarded for his sake
With coronal age and death like quieting balm.

For trophies on a savage temple wall

Wonder and Joy,"The things that one grows tired of—O, be sure
They are only foolish artificial things!
Can a bird ever tire of having wings?
And I, so long as life and sense endure,
(Or brief be they!) shall nevermore inure
My heart to the recurrence of the springs,
Of gray dawns, the gracious evenings,
The infinite wheeling stars. A wonder pure
Must ever well within me to behold
Venus decline; or great Orion, whose belt
Is studded with three nails of burning gold,
Ascend the winter heaven. Who never felt
This wondering joy may yet be good or great:
But envy him not: he is not fortunate.",Robinson Jeffers,sonnet
Peace,"Now, God be thanked who has matched us with his hour,

Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary; 
      Leave the sick hearts that honor could not move, 
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary, 
      And all the little emptiness of love! 
Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there, 
      Where there’s no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending, 
            Naught broken save this body, lost but breath; 
Nothing to shake the laughing heart’s long peace there,

Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be 
      Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene, 
      That men call age; and those who would have been, 
Their sons, they gave, their immortality. 
 
Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth, 
      Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain,

Safety,"Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blest

We have found safety with all things undying, 
      The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth, 
The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying, 
      And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth. 
We have built a house that is not for Time’s throwing. 
      We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever. 
War knows no power. Safe shall be my going, 
      Secretly armed against all death’s endeavour; 
Safe though all safety’s lost; safe where men fall; 
And if these poor limbs die, safest of all.",Rupert Brooke,sonnet
The Dead (IV),"These hearts were woven of human joys and cares, 
      Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth. 
The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs, 
      And sunset, and the colours of the earth. 
These had seen movement, and heard music; known 
      Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended; 
Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone; 
      Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended. 
 
There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter 
And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after, 
      Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance 
And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white

A width, a shining peace, under the night.",Rupert Brooke,sonnet

That its sure processes sort out and bind
Brave hearts in one intrepid brotherhood
And leave the shams and imbeciles behind.

And the pursuit of cheerless toil enchain,
Who from their desk-chairs seeing a summer cloud
Race through blue heaven on its joyful course
Sigh sometimes for a life less cramped and bowed,
I think I might have done a great deal worse;
For I have ever gone untied and free,
The stars and my high thoughts for company;
Wet with the salt-spray and the mountain showers,
I have had the sense of space and amplitude,
And love in many places, silver-shoed,
Has come and scattered all my path with flowers.

With Tyranny whose bloody toll enflames
A generous people to heroic war;
Whether with Freedom, stretched in her own gore,
Whose pleading hands and suppliant distress
Still offer hearts that thirst for Righteousness
A glorious cause to strike or perish for.

Terrace and lawn, trim hedge and flowering vine,
Crown with fair culture all the sounding shore.
How sweet, to such a place, on such a night,

Winter Remembered,"Two evils, monstrous either one apart, 
Possessed me, and were long and loath at going: 
A cry of Absence, Absence, in the heart, 
And in the wood the furious winter blowing. 

Think not, when fire was bright upon my bricks 
And past the tight boards hardly a wind could enter, 
I glowed like them, the simple burning sticks, 
Far from my cause, my proper heat, my center. 

Better to walk forth in the murderous air 
And wash my wound in the snows; that would be healing, 
Because my heart would throb less painful there, 
Being caked with cold, and past the smart of feeling. 

Which would you choose, and for what boot in gold, 
The absence, or the absence and the cold? ",John Crowe Ransom,sonnet

Naked, uplifting in a laden tray
New milk and honey and sweet-tinctured wine,
Not without twigs of clustering apple-spray
To wreath a garland for Our Lady's shrine.
The morning planet poised above the sea
Shall drop sweet influence through her drowsing lid;
Dew-drenched, his delicate virginity
Shall scarce disturb the flowers he kneels amid,

When Dawn Comes to the City," The tired cars go grumbling by,

Outcast,"For the dim regions whence my fathers came

Words felt, but never heard, my lips would frame;
My soul would sing forgotten jungle songs.

The far-reflected sky in dark of dream;
And glimpsed therein the sun-winged swallows seem
As fleeting memories to those who weep.

So mirrored in thy heart are all desires,
Eternal longings, Youth’s inheritance,
All hopes that token immortality,
All griefs whereto immortal grief aspires.
Aweary of the world’s reality,
I dream above the imaged pool, Romance.

Anthem for Doomed Youth,"What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?

Only the stuttering rifles’ rapid rattle 
Can patter out their hasty orisons. 
No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; 
Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, 
The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells; 
And bugles calling for them from sad shires. 
What candles may be held to speed them all? 
Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes 
Shall shine the holy glimmers of good-byes. 
The pallor of girls’ brows shall be their pall; 
Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,

The busy needle of her light to bring,
And stitch, and stitch, upon the dead day’s shroud.
Poises the sun upon his west, a spark
Superlative,—and dives beneath the world;
From the day’s fillets Night shakes out her locks;

Do hourly wait to pass your pathway down.
You, so familiar, once were strange: we tried
To live as of your presence unaware.
But now in every road on every side
We see your straight and steadfast signpost there.

I think it like that signpost in my land
Hoary and tall, which pointed me to go
Upward, into the hills, on the right hand,
Where the mists swim and the winds shriek and blow,
A homeless land and friendless, but a land
I did not know and that I wished to know.

Such, such is Death: no triumph: no defeat:
Only an empty pail, a slate rubbed clean,
A merciful putting away of what has been.

And this we know: Death is not Life effete,
Life crushed, the broken pail. We who have seen
So marvellous things know well the end not yet.

Victor and vanquished are a-one in death:
Coward and brave: friend, foe. Ghosts do not say,
“Come, what was your record when you drew breath?”
But a big blot has hid each yesterday
So poor, so manifestly incomplete.
And your bright Promise, withered long and sped,
Is touched, stirs, rises, opens and grows sweet
And blossoms and is you, when you are dead.",Charles Hamilton Sorley,sonnet
To Germany,"You are blind like us. Your hurt no man designed,
And no man claimed the conquest of your land.
But gropers both through fields of thought confined
We stumble and we do not understand.
You only saw your future bigly planned,
And we, the tapering paths of our own mind,
And in each other's dearest ways we stand,
And hiss and hate. And the blind fight the blind.
When it is peace, then we may view again
With new-won eyes each other's truer form
And wonder. Grown more loving-kind and warm
We'll grasp firm hands and laugh at the old pain,
When it is peace. But until peace, the storm
The darkness and the thunder and the rain.",Charles Hamilton Sorley,sonnet
When You See Millions of the Mouthless Dead',"When you see millions of the mouthless dead
Across your dreams in pale battalions go,
Say not soft things as other men have said,
That you'll remember. For you need not so.
Give them not praise. For, deaf, how should they know
It is not curses heaped on each gashed head?
Nor tears. Their blind eyes see not your tears flow.
Nor honour. It is easy to be dead.
Say only this, “They are dead.” Then add thereto,
“Yet many a better one has died before.”
Then, scanning all the o'ercrowded mass, should you
Perceive one face that you loved heretofore,
It is a spook. None wears the face you knew.
Great death has made all his for evermore.",Charles Hamilton Sorley,sonnet
I Know It Will Be Quiet When You Come,"I know it will be quiet when you come:
No wind; the water breathing steadily;
A light like ghost of silver on the sea;
And the surf dreamily fingering his drum.
Twilight will drift in large and leave me numb
With nearness to the last tranquility;
And then the slow and languorous tyranny
Of orange moon, pale night, and cricket hum.

And suddenly there will be twist of tide,
A rustling as of thin silk on the sand,
The tremor of a presence at my side,
The tremble of a hand upon my hand:
And pulses sharp with pain, and fires fanned,
And words that stumble into stars and hide.",Joseph Auslander,sonnet
A Gull Goes Up,"Gulls when they fly move in a liquid arc,
Still head, and wings that bend above the breast, 
Covering its glitter with a cloak of dark,
Gulls fly. So as at last toward balm and rest, 
Remembering wings, the desperate leave their earth, 
Bear from their earth what there was ruinous-crossed,
Peace from distress, and love from nothing-worth, 
Fast at the heart, its jewels of dear cost.

Gulls go up hushed to that entrancing flight,
With never a feather of all the body stirred.
So in an air less rare than longing might 
The dream of flying lift a marble bird.
Desire it is that flies; then wings are freight 
That only bear the feathered heart no weight.",Léonie Adams,sonnet
Challenge,"I said, in drunken pride of youth and you 
That mischief-making Time would never dare 
Play his ill-humored tricks upon us two, 
Strange and defiant lovers that we were.
I said that even Death, Highwayman Death,
Could never master lovers such as we,
That even when his clutch had throttled breath,
My hymns would float in praise, undauntedly. 

I did not think such words were bravado.
Oh, I think honestly we knew no fear, 
We loved each other so. 
And thus, with you believing me, I made 
My prophecies, rebellious, unafraid . . . . 
And that was foolish, wasn’t it, my dear? ",Sterling A. Brown,sonnet
Sonnet 1,"He came in silvern armour, trimmed with black—
A lover come from legends long ago—
With silver spurs and silken plumes a-blow,
And flashing sword caught fast and buckled back
In a carven sheath of Tamarack.
He came with footsteps beautifully slow,
And spoke in voice meticulously low.
He came and Romance followed in his track...

I did not ask his name—I thought him Love;
I did not care to see his hidden face.
All life seemed born in my intaken breath;
All thought seemed flown like some forgotten dove.
He bent to kiss and raised his visor's lace...
All eager-lipped I kissed the mouth of Death.",Gwendolyn Bennett,sonnet
Sonnet 2,"Some things are very dear to me—
Such things as flowers bathed by rain
Or patterns traced upon the sea
Or crocuses where snow has lain ...
the iridescence of a gem,
The moon’s cool opalescent light,
Azaleas and the scent of them,
And honeysuckles in the night.
And many sounds are also dear—
Like winds that sing among the trees
Or crickets calling from the weir
Or Negroes humming melodies.
But dearer far than all surmise
Are sudden tear-drops in your eyes.",Gwendolyn Bennett,sonnet
Wind,"The wind was a care-free soul  
    That broke the chains of earth,  
And strode for a moment across the land
    With the wild halloo of his mirth. 
He little cared that he ripped up trees,  
    That houses fell at his hand,  
That his step broke calm on the breast of seas,  
    That his feet stirred clouds of sand.  

But when he had had his little joke,  
    Had shouted and laughed and sung,  
When the trees were scarred, their branches broke,  
    And their foliage aching hung,  
He crept to his cave with a stealthy tread,  
    With rain-filled eyes and low-bowed head.",Gwendolyn Bennett,sonnet
From the Dark Tower,"We shall not always plant while others reap
The golden increment of bursting fruit, 
Not always countenance, abject and mute, 
That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap;
Not everlastingly while others sleep
Shall we beguile their limbs with mellow flute,
Not always bend to some more subtle brute;
We were not made eternally to weep.

The night whose sable breast relieves the stark 
White stars is no less lovely, being dark;
And there are buds that cannot bloom at all
In light, but crumple, piteous, and fall;
So in the dark we hide the heart that bleeds,
And wait, and tend our agonizing seeds. ",Countee Cullen,sonnet
Protest,"I long not now, a little while at least, 
For that serene interminable hour 
When I shall leave this barmecidal feast, 
With poppy for my everlasting flower. 
I long not now for that dim cubicle 
Of earth to which my lease will not expire, 
Where he who comes a tenant there may dwell 
Without a thought of famine, flood, or fire. 

Surely that house has quiet to bestow:
Still tongue, spent pulse, heart pumped of its last throb,
The fingers tense and tranquil in a row, 
The throat unwelled with any sigh or sob. 
But time to live, to love, bear pain and smile,
Oh, we are given such a little while! ",Countee Cullen,sonnet
The Dance of Love,"All night we danced upon our windy hill,
Your dress a cloud of tangled midnight hair,
And love was much too much for me to wear
My leaves; the killer roared above his kill,
But you danced on, and when some star would spill
Its red and white upon you whirling there,
I sensed a hidden beauty in the air;
Though you danced on, my heart and I stood still.

But suddenly a bit of morning crept
Along your trembling sides of ebony;
I saw the tears your tired limbs had wept,
And how your breasts heaved high, how languidly
Your dark arms moved; I drew you close to me;
We flung ourselves upon our hill and slept.",Countee Cullen,sonnet
Yet Do I Marvel,"I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind,
And did He stoop to quibble could tell why
The little buried mole continues blind,
Why flesh that mirrors Him must some day die,
Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus
Is baited by the fickle fruit, declare
If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus
To struggle up a never-ending stair.
Inscrutable His ways are, and immune
To catechism by a mind too strewn
With petty cares to slightly understand
What awful brain compels His awful hand.
Yet do I marvel at this curious thing:
To make a poet black, and bid him sing!",Countee Cullen,sonnet
I Have a Rendezvous With Life,"I have a rendezvous with Life,
In days I hope will come,
Ere youth has sped, and strength of mind,
Ere voices sweet grow dumb.
I have a rendezvous with Life,
When Spring's first heralds hum.
Sure some would cry it's better far
To crown their days with sleep
Than face the road, the wind and rain,
To heed the calling deep.
Though wet nor blow nor space I fear,
Yet fear I deeply, too,
Lest Death should meet and claim me ere
I keep Life's rendezvous.",Countee Cullen,sonnet
Finis,"Now that our love has drifted 
To a quiet close, 
Leaving the empty ache 
That always follows when beauty goes; 
Now that you and I, 
Who stood tip-toe on earth 
To touch our fingers to the sky, 
Have turned away 
To allow our little love to die— 
Go, dear, seek again the magic touch. 
But if you are wise, 
As I shall be wise, 
You will not again 
Love over much.",Waring Cuney,sonnet
Manila Bay,"I sit upon the white rocks by the bay,
Against whose hollows numberless, the waves
Will splash forevermore. The sunset laves
The deep with light. There rise far away
A mountain that has seemingly defied
The very clouds unchanged. And near, portending
That all created things will have an ending,
These crumbled crags lie by the ocean side!
O time! what element escapes your slow
And causeless move? These rough, resisting rocks,
Which the wind startled wave incessant mocks,
Are not to it unyielding even now. 
The day is done, for once it had a beaming,
And so must all, whatever may be seeming.",Luis G. Dato,sonnet
Sonnet [Whyfore must minstrels unattended sing],"Whyfore must minstrels unattended sing
And utter sounds by no one understood?
The shy doves coo their music to the wood
And wild—as soon responsive echoes sing:
Perfuméd flowers impetuously will fling
Such exhalations like to harmony;
The moaning waves, the blood-red clouds on high,
In our soul’s sympathy are wantoning;
But these the poets offer from their art,
Are whispers wafted from some alien strain.
Perhaps they rise as secrets of the heart,
That, surging, sink, and, sinking, surge again,
Perhaps the accents geniuses impart,
Aroused by godly impulse, heard in vain.",Luis G. Dato,sonnet
Sonnet [Upon these deeps in days remotely old],"Upon these deeps in days remotely old, 
A daring band of Malays flung their sails 
Intrepidly. On tempests, storms, and gales, 
On ocean furies, full their valor told, 
Each gust a grave, each grave a tale unscrolled, 
A covert pathos of the tongueless wave
For utterance suspiring. O the brave 
Unnumbered dead that slumber in their fold! 
Some day a bark of light will Hereward glide. 
By no one sent, whence no one living knows, 
And, breaking centuries of deep repose, 
Upgather from the sea the dead who died
In search of it. A gleam these deeps will tear, 
And give new life to all that slumbered there.",Luis G. Dato,sonnet
Argonauts,"From Asia’s teeming highlands, coasts and bays, 
They ploughed the outmost rim of ocean foam,
In pathless deeps envisioning a home 
Where suns perennial drop unslanted rays. 
They ventured from the people-trodden ways,
And in their light, swift-wingéd barangays,
The seas below, aloft the flaming skies, 
They found the ocean haven of Malays. 
They set their eyes on points unvisited,
On wave-lapped isles enchantedly remote, 
The yawning reefs kept tally of the dead, 
Transforming into graves the homes they sought. 
From Asia’s naked shores by fancy led, 
They spread their sails, and drifted, monsoon-caught.",Luis G. Dato,sonnet
Sonnet [Our days in swift succession bid us on],"Our days in swift succession bid us on
To these unchartered, desolate domains, 
Where over deserts strewn with the remains
Of unreturning caravans long gone, 
We follow trails that, winding, go astray
Into the dull horizon. We know not
What ending’s there, what fortunes be our lot, 
When tired and spent we reach our destined way. 
We only know that with each onward move, 
We leave behind us friends we cherished most, 
Old friends, who, unsustained, their path have lost, 
Warm hearts that, hoping, beat for those they love. 
We know that time relentless bids us on
To stranger lands, only to dead men known.",Luis G. Dato,sonnet
Mother,"When evenings cast pale shadows on the earth, 
And silence, like a vast mysterious ghost, 
Stifles the land and sea from hill to coast, 
And buries all that tropic suns gave birth,
When by myself I pace the darkened shore,
And think of this unhappy lot of mine, 
The pain and grief the fates to me assign, 
I sigh for you, O mother I adore! 
That I could seek your bosom as of old, 
And, nestling there, bare secrets that oppress,
Accuse these that my love would disposses, 
Whose hearts to cold desires and base are sold! 
O mother dear! When death relieves our sighs,
Shall we in heaven, meet, in Paradise?",Luis G. Dato,sonnet
Delirium,"In this state of the mind when the least sound perplexes, 
And the faintest light shadow the spirit depresses, 
When the pen, hesitating, conjectures and guesses 
On the scheme enigmatic of mortals and sexes;
When the twilight with shadow the bosom but vexes,
And the morning with sunlight the temper oppresses,
When society of men a mere boredom expresses, 
And the phantom of silence, a war of complexes:
Then I think of the second new life of hereafter, 
Which will claim at a call my lone soul from the earth, 
Of the day when I cease from all tear-drops and laughter, 
When the born things are dead, and the dead given birth. 
From my bed of repose I, recalling, would waft her
The one halcyon remembrance of our passionate mirth.",Luis G. Dato,sonnet
Sonnet [This day when waking from pertubéd sleep],"This day when waking from pertubéd sleep,
I see the dim night die upon the dawn,
And gaze on gleaming hill and dewy lawn,
On sunbeams soft that o’er the valley peep;
When Nature seems with ecstasy to weep
At seeing earth and sky so lovely grown,
And innocently to herself alone
Counts and recounts the flowers and clouds they keep,
How clearly do I see through thin green leaves
The truth that only beauteous dawns arouse;
The smallness of the mortal man who grieves,
Whose eyes to loveliness perpetual drowse.
O blesséd morning! how the long dead heaves
To life, suspiring on the blossoming boughs.",Luis G. Dato,sonnet
Pagan Passion,"I am sweetly perplexed by love sallies, releases,
By the countless retreats and the numberless captures,
By the petulant coldness and agreeable raptures,
By the whisper of phrases that hurts and then pleases,
I am drunk by the prodigal total of leases
From her body and spirit, her soul and her senses,
I revel in approaches and artless offenses,
In her challenging taunts and her tenderly teases.
Now will I disengage a red flower from her tresses,
And uplift her lithe form from a divan of roses,
For the zephyr of night too much passion opposes,
And in delicate folds now has rumpled her dresses.
On tomorrow’s new ventures the heart eager presses,
I repose now to ponder on life-soothing losses.",Luis G. Dato,sonnet
Sonnet to a Negro in Harlem,"You are disdainful and magnificent—
Your perfect body and your pompous gait,
Your dark eyes flashing solemnly with hate,
Small wonder that you are incompetent
To imitate those whom you so despise—
Your shoulders towering high above the throng,
Your head thrown back in rich, barbaric song,
Palm trees and mangoes stretched before your eyes.
Let others toil and sweat for labor’s sake
And wring from grasping hands their meed of gold.
Why urge ahead your supercilious feet?
Scorn will efface each footprint that you make.
I love your laughter arrogant and bold.
You are too splendid for this city street.",Helene Johnson,sonnet
Remember Not,"Remember not the promises we made
In this same garden many moons ago.
You must forget them. I would have it so.
Old vows are like old flowers as they fade
And vaguely vanish in a feeble death.
There is no reason why your hands should clutch
At pretty yesterdays. There is not much
Of beauty in me now. And though my breath
Is quick, my body sentient, my heart
Attuned to romance as before, you must
Not, through mistaken chivalry, pretend
To love me still. There is no mortal art
Can overcome Time’s deep, corroding rust.
Let Love’s beginning expiate Love’s end.",Helene Johnson,sonnet
Dreams,"Mysterious shapes, with wands of joy and pain,
Which seize us unaware in helpless sleep,
And lead us to the houses where we keep
Our secrets hid, well barred by every chain
That we can forge and bind: the crime whose stain
Is slowly fading ’neath the tears we weep;
Dead bliss which, dead, can make our pulses leap—
Oh, cruelty! To make these live again!
They say that death is sleep, and heaven’s rest
Ends earth’s short day, as, on the last faint gleam
Of sun, our nights shut down, and we are blest.
Let this, then, be of heaven’s joy the test,
The proof if heaven be, or only seem,
That we forever choose what we will dream!",Helen Hunt Jackson,sonnet
Winter Leafage,"Each year I mark one lone outstanding tree,
Clad in its robings of the summer past,
Dry, wan, and shivering in the wintry blast.
It will not pay the season’s rightful fee,—
It will not set its frost-burnt leafage free;
But like some palsied miser all aghast,
Who hoards his sordid treasure to the last,
It sighs, it moans, it sings in eldritch glee.
A foolish tree, to dote on summers gone;
A faithless tree, that never feels how spring
Creeps up the world to make a leafy dawn,
And recompense for all despoilment bring!
Oh, let me not, heyday and youth withdrawn,
With failing hands to their vain semblance cling!",Edith Matilda Thomas,sonnet
Plácido’s Farewell to His Mother,"            ⁠If the unfortunate fate engulfing me, 
The ending of my history of grief, 
The closing of my span of years so brief, 
Mother, should wake a single pang in thee, 
Weep not. No saddening thought to me devote; 
I calmly go to a death that is glory-filled, 
My lyre before it is forever stilled 
Breathes out to thee its last and dying note. 

            ⁠A note scarce more than a burden-easing sigh, 
Tender and sacred, innocent, sincere— 
Spontaneous and instinctive as the cry 
I gave at birth—And now the hour is here— 
O God, thy mantle of mercy o’er my sins! 
Mother, farewell! The pilgrimage begins. 

 

 

 

   Si la suerte fatal que me ha cabido, 
Y el triste fin de mi sangrienta historia, 
Al salir de esta vida transitoria 
Deja tu corazon de muerte herido; 
   Baste de llanto: el ánimo afligido 
Recobre su quietud; moro en la gloria, 
Y mi plácida lira á tu memoria 
Lanza en la tumba su postrer sonido. 

   Sonido dulce, melodioso y santo, 
Glorioso, espiritual, puro y divino, 
Inocente, espontáneo como el llanto 
   Que vertiera al nacer: ya el cuello inclino! 
Ya de la religión me cubre el manto! 
Adios, mi madre! adios—El Peregrino. ",Gabriel de la Concepción Valdés,sonnet

Sonnets from the Cherokee (I),"My heart is like an opal, flashing fire 
And flaming gleams of pointed light 
At thy approach; or lying cold and white 
When thou art gone; robbed of a dream’s desire 
Is left moon-white and dull; no darting flame 
Or sapphire gleam to mark a sweet suspense.
But only still, benumbed indifference 
Unwaked at thy soft whisper of my name. 
Come now, I tire of waiting to know love; 
Teach me to scorn indifference white and dim 
For I would drain fate’s cup of joy or strife; 
Would play to the lost chord the vibrant hymn 
That passion sings; my heart lifted above 
Dull apathy; pulsating; knowing Life.",Ruth Muskrat Bronson,sonnet
Sonnets from the Cherokee (III),"What is this nameless something that I want,
Forever groping blindly, without light,—
A ghost of pain that does forever haunt
My days, and make my heart eternal night?
I think it is your face I so long for,
Your eyes that read my soul at one warm glance;
Your lips that I may touch with mine no more
Have left me in their stead a thrusting lance
Of fire that burns my lips and sears my heart
As all the dreary wanton years wear through
Their hopeless dragging days. No lover’s art
Can lift full, heavy sorrow from my view
Or still my restless longing, purge my hate,
Because I learned I loved you, dear, too late.",Ruth Muskrat Bronson,sonnet
The New Year,"The New Year comes—fling wide, fling wide the door
Of Opportunity! the spirit free
To scale the utmost heights of hopes to be,
To rest on peaks ne’er reached by man before!
The boundless infinite let us explore,
To search out undiscovered mystery,
Undreamed of in our poor philosophy!
The bounty of the gods upon us pour!
Nay, in the New Year we shall be as gods:
No longer apish puppets or dull clods
Of clay; but poised, empowered to command,
Upon the Etna of New Worlds we’ll stand—
This scant earth-raiment to the winds will cast—
Full richly robed as supermen at last!",Carrie Williams Clifford,sonnet
To Edison,"In thee, the spirit of thy native soil
    Draws breath and stirs with potent fruitful life.
Thou, from the field of elemental strife,
    Seizest the guerdon of thy noble toil.

Franklin before, along the slender coil
    Called down the fiery sparks in heaven rife.
Traced the quick ray, like sharp dividing knife;
    And to the earth brought down the lightning’s spoil.

And thou, the living glory of thy race,
    Preservest for all time the spoken word;
Defying ignorance’s numbing trace;
    Despising falsehood’s deadly withering breath.
The immortal tree of life thy hand conferred,
    Even on the edge of the abyss of death.",Domingo de Vivero,sonnet
Moonlight on Manila Bay,"A light, serene, ethereal glory rests 
Its beams effulgent on each crestling wave; 
The silver touches of the moonlight wave 
The deep bare bosom that the breeze molests; 
While lingering whispers deepen as the wavy crests 
Roll with weird rhythm, now gay, now gently grave; 
And floods of lambent light appear the sea to pave— 
All cast a spell that heeds not time’s behests. 

Not always such the scene; the din of fight 
Has swelled the murmur of the peaceful air; 
Here East and West have oft displayed their might; 
Dark battle clouds have dimmed this scene so fair; 
Here bold Olympia, one historic night, 
Presaging freedom, claimed a people’s care. ",Fernando M. Maramág,sonnet
Edgar Allan Poe,"I know not why, but it is true—it may,
In some way, be because he was a child
Of the fierce sun where I first wept and smiled—
I love the dark-browed Poe. His feverish day
Was spent in dreams inspired, that him beguiled,
When not along his path shone forth one ray
Of light, of hope, to guide him on the way,
That to earth's cares he might be reconciled.
Not one of all Columbia's tuneful choir
Has pitched his notes to such a matchless key
As Poe—the wizard of the Orphic lyre!
Not one has dreamed, has sung, such songs as he,
   Who, like an echo came, an echo went,
   Singing, back to his mother element.",Timothy Thomas Fortune,sonnet
With Music,"Dear, did we meet in some dim yesterday?
    I half remember how the birds were mute
    Among green leaves and tulip-tinted fruit,
And on the grass, beside a stream, we lay
In early twilight; faintly, far away,
    Came lovely sounds adrift from silver lute,
    With answered echoes of an airy flute,
While Twilight waited tiptoe, fain to stay.

Her violet eyes were sweet with mystery.
    You looked in mine, the music rose and fell
Like little, lisping laughter of the sea;
        Our souls were barks, wind-wafted from the shore—
     Gold cup, a rose, a ruby, who can tell?
         Soft—music ceases—I recall no more.

The Depths of the Grass,"Look, in the early light, 
   Down to the infinite 
   Depths at the deep grass-roots; 
      Where the sun shoots 
In golden veins, as looking through 
   A dear pool one sees it do; 
   Where campion drifts 
Its bladders, iris-brinded, through the rifts 
      Of rising, falling seed
   That the winds lightly scour—
Down to the matted earth where over 
   And over again crow’s-foot and clover
      And pink bindweed
      Dimly, steadily flower.",Michael Field,sonnet
Love the Light-Giver,"To Tommaso De’ Cavalieri

Veggio co’ bei vostri occhi.

With your fair eyes a charming light I see,
    For which my own blind eyes would peer in vain;
    Stayed by your feet, the burden I sustain
    Which my lame feet find all too strong for me;
Wingless upon your pinions forth I fly;
    Heavenward your spirit stirreth me to strain;
    E'en as you will, I blush and blanch again,
    Freeze in the sun, burn ’neath a frosty sky.
Your will includes and is the lord of mine;
    Life to my thoughts within your heart is given;
    My words begin to breathe upon your breath:
Like to the moon am I, that cannot shine
    Alone; for lo! our eyes see nought in heaven
    Save what the living sun illumineth.",Michelangelo Buonarroti,sonnet
September,"O golden month! How high thy gold is heaped!
The yellow birch-leaves shine like bright coins strung
On wands; the chestnut's yellow pennons tongue
To every wind its harvest challenge. Steeped
In yellow, still lie fields where wheat was reaped;
And yellow still the corn sheaves, stacked among
The yellow gourds, which from the earth have wrung
Her utmost gold. To highest boughs have leaped
The purple grape,—last thing to ripen, late
By very reason of its precious cost.
O Heart, remember, vintages are lost
If grapes do not for freezing night-dews wait.
Think, while thou sunnest thyself in Joy's estate,
Mayhap thou canst not ripen without frost!",Helen Hunt Jackson,sonnet
Sonnet—Baugmaree,"A sea of foliage girds our garden round,
        But not a sea of dull unvaried green,
        Sharp contrasts of all colours here are seen;
The light-green graceful tamarinds abound
Amid the mangoe clumps of green profound,
        And palms arise, like pillars gray, between;
        And o'er the quiet pools the seemuls lean,
Red,—red, and startling like a trumpet's sound.
But nothing can be lovelier than the ranges
        Of bamboos to the eastward, when the moon
Looks through their gaps, and the white lotus changes
        Into a cup of silver. One might swoon
               Drunken with beauty then, or gaze and gaze
               On a primeval Eden, in amaze.",Toru Dutt,sonnet
Sonnet to Winter,"Thy brow is girt, thy robe with gems inwove;
    And palaces of frost-work, on the eye,
    Flash out, and gleam in every gorgeous dye,
The pencil, dipped in glorious things above,
    Can bring to earth. Oh, thou art passing fair!
But cold and cheerless as the heart of death,
Without one warm, free pulse, one softening breath,
    One soothing whisper for the ear of Care.
Fortune too has her Winter. In the Spring,
    We watch the bud of promise; and the flower
    Looks out upon us at the Summer hour;
And Autumn days the blessed harvest bring;
    Then comes the reign of jewels rare, and gold,
    When brows flash light, but hearts grow strangely cold.",Emily Chubbuck Judson,sonnet
Sonnet VII,"Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No.
It is immortal as immaculate Truth,
'Tis not a blossom shed as soon as youth,
Drops from the stem of life—for it will grow,
In barren regions, where no waters flow,
Nor rays of promise cheats the pensive gloom.
A darkling fire, faint hovering o'er a tomb,
That but itself and darkness nought doth show,
It is my love's being yet it cannot die,
Nor will it change, though all be changed beside;
Though fairest beauty be no longer fair,
Though vows be false, and faith itself deny,
Though sharp enjoyment be a suicide,
And hope a spectre in a ruin bare.",Hartley Coleridge,sonnet
Sonnet VIII,"Mondego! thou, whose waters cold and clear 
Gird those green banks, where fancy fain would stay, 
Fondly to muse on that departed day 
When Hope was kind and Friendship seem’d sincere; 
—Ere I had purchas’d knowledge with a tear.
—Mondego! though I bend my pilgrim way 
To other shores, where other fountains stray,
And other rivers roll their proud career, 
Still—nor shall time, nor grief, nor stars severe, 
Nor widening distance e’er prevail in aught 
To make thee less to this sad bosom dear; 
And Memory oft, by old Affection taught, 
Shall lightly speed upon the plumes of thought, 
To bathe amongst thy waters cold and clear!

 

 

 

Doces e claras aguas do Mondego, 
Doce repouso de minha lembrança, 
Onde a comprida e pérfida esperança 
Longo tempo apoz si me trouxe cego.
De vós me aparto, si; porém não nego, 
Que inda a longa memoria, que me alcança. 
Me não deixa de vós fazer mudança. 
Mas quanto mais me alongo, mais me achego.
Bem poderá a Fortuna este instrumento 
Da alma levar por terra nova e extranha, 
Oíferecido ao mar remoto, ao vento.
Mas a alma, que de cá vos acompanha. 
Nas azas do ligeiro pensamento 
Para vós, aguas, vôa, e em vós se banha.",Luís de Camões,sonnet
Sappho and Phaon: Sonnet III,"Turn to yon vale beneath, whose tangled shade
Excludes the blazing torch of noon-day light,
Where sportive Fawns, and dimpled Loves invite,
The bow'r of Pleasure opens to the glade:
Lull'd by soft flutes, on leaves of violets laid,
There witching beauty greets the ravish'd sight,
More gentle than the arbitress of night
In all her silv'ry panoply array'd!
The birds breathe bliss! light zephyrs kiss the ground,
Stealing the hyacinth's divine perfume;
While from the pellucid fountains glitt'ring round,
small tinkling rills bid rival flow'rets bloom!
HERE, laughing Cupids bathe the bosom's wound;
THERE, tyrant passion finds a glorious tomb!",Mary Robinson,sonnet
Sonnet 100,"In night when colors all to black are cast,
Distinction lost, or gone down with the light;
The eye a watch to inward senses placed,
Not seeing, yet still having powers of sight,

Gives vain alarums to the inward sense,
Where fear stirred up with witty tyranny,
Confounds all powers, and thorough self-offense,
Doth forge and raise impossibility:

Such as in thick depriving darknesses,
Proper reflections of the error be,
And images of self-confusednesses,
Which hurt imaginations only see;

And from this nothing seen, tells news of devils,
Which but expressions be of inward evils.",Lord Brooke Fulke Greville,sonnet
"Sonnet 7 [The soote season, that bud and bloom forth brings] ","The soote season, that bud and bloom forth brings
With green hath clad the hill and eke the vale;
The nightingale with feathers new she sings;
And turtle to her make hath told her tale.
Summer is come, for every spray now springs;
The hart hath hung his old head on the pale;
The buck in brake his winter coat he flings;
The fishes flete with new repairèd scale;
The adder all her slough away she slings;
The swift swalllow pursueth the flies small;
The busy bee her honey now she mings;
Winter is worn that was the flowers' bale.
And thus I see among these pleasant things
Each care decays, and yet my sorrow springs.",Henry Howard,sonnet
"Sonnet 12 [Alas, so all things now do hold their peace] ","Alas, so all things now do hold their peace,
Heaven and earth disturbèd in no thing;
The beasts, the air, the birds their song do cease;
The nightes car the stars about doth bring.
Calm is the sea, the waves work less and less.
So am not I, whom love, alas, doth wring,
Bringing before my face the great increase
Of my desires, whereat I weep and sing
In joy and woe, as in a doubtful ease.
For my sweet thoughts sometime do pleasure bring,
But by and by the cause of my disease
Gives me a pang that inwardly doth sting,
When that I think what grief it is again
To live and lack the thing should rid my pain.",Henry Howard,sonnet
All American Ghazal,"On our first date, I admit I haven’t left since arriving to this country.
So, of course, being dramatic, I became a poet’s country.

Years after divorce, I lost a custody fight, in part, because of
my status—so, indeed, a free country.

Pho in the South End. Oxtail in Queens. Tinned fish. Cannoli in
Little Italy. No-contact delivery. The food of my country.

Fifty or so provincial patches of grass—upon closer look—leaves. 
The edge, where people live, frays in this country.

“We can work on human rights while negotiating,” the Senator 
says, “the prospects of nuclear war in our country.”

I was born in the Philippines, so my native tongue is partisanship.
I’m many parties. I’m made impartial by my country—

a professional, ministerial office holder. A biblical fortune.
It’s libidinal, the we in the ballad that makes a land.

It’s provisional, the line that cuts through sand. I is a line
with a place to stand. I is a framing device. What good is a nation. 

Parts of speech like mine fragment. Cut. Clean. I’m rightless 
but I have capital. Charge me, Dujie, precis a person. ",Dujie Tahat,ghazal
Even The Rain,"What will suffice for a true-love knot? Even the rain?

But he has bought grief’s lottery, bought even the rain.

“Our glosses / wanting in this world”—“Can you remember?”

Anyone!—“when we thought / the poets taught” even the rain?

After we died—That was it!—God left us in the dark.

And as we forgot the dark, we forgot even the rain.

Drought was over. Where was I? Drinks were on the house.

For mixers, my love, you’d poured—what?—even the rain.

Of this pear-shaped orange’s perfumed twist, I will say:

Extract Vermouth from the bergamot, even the rain.

How did the Enemy love you—with earth? air? and fire?

He held just one thing back till he got even: the rain.

This is God’s site for a new house of executions?

You swear by the Bible, Despot, even the rain?

After the bones—those flowers—this was found in the urn:

The lost river, ashes from the ghat, even the rain.

What was I to prophesy if not the end of the world?

A salt pillar for the lonely lot, even the rain.

How the air raged, desperate, streaming the earth with flames—

To help burn down my house, Fire sought even the rain.

He would raze the mountains, he would level the waves;

he would, to smooth his epic plot, even the rain.

New York belongs at daybreak to only me, just me—

To make this claim Memory’s brought even the rain.

They’ve found the knife that killed you, but whose prints are these?

Rumor of 6th grade sunrise, dressed in you I was a child
of unspeakable obsession. Archaic language, Giolureade

Until Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scots. Her lips unlocked
your sarcenet line, my fingers knew taste before the orange

Dared on Norwood apartments, Dutch colonies
hunted man straight into your family crests of orange

Scraped from dust to crown our bruises, warriors we
stared directly into the sun, Tainos dyed in orange

As if we always knew we were history. Amber hardened into gold
tricking mortals, mortals tricking gods asking Was it the fruit or the color?

First, Tibbets’ grove, millions of fruits grafted
instead of born, from two parent orange trees

The key to a philosopher’s stone: Colormen flirting
with volcanos to retrieve your arsenic orpiment

Forever in danger of sliding into another color, I ran
after you, tracing rivers and creeks and streams of citrus

The Washington Navel Orange, a second fruit protruding:
not a twin, nor translation, but a new name every season.",Noel Quiñones,ghazal
Ghazal Circling Fatherhood,"My mother exalts her long-gone father.
Driving home, laments the failings of my father.

Sees her ex-husband in my excuses,
tells me: That’s just like your father. 

On holiday, he sneaks away to work;
I take a work call. Like son, like father.

Before, I tried to outrun my shadow
when sun met twilight, like Earth’s late father.

God sacrificed his son for his life’s work.
So we sing heavenward to honor the Father,

the Son, and the Holy Spirit—Forgive me,
for I have sinned, become my own father—

not who raised me, but those who claim me
as theirs. The stone-jawed men who father

havoc through absence, posture a myth for
any gaze. How many don’t know their father?

I’m at my kids’ school, bath time, rubbing their backs
before bed. They will know their father

as the one who showed up & always stayed,
bleary-eyed, did anything to father.

My mother fears she will be forgotten,
invoking Time, like others, as a father.

What gravity gives birth to a father?",Carlos Andrés Gómez,ghazal
Ghazal: Sea,"As Karen Blixen said, the cure’s the sea
—or sweat, or tears—but I prefer the sea.

In fact, it’s homeopathy. Why cry
with eyes baptised (if reddened) by the sea?

The metaphors of fabric come to mind:
cool silk or aqua velvet, summer sea

            (or better, come to body: intimate,
            enveloped skin on skin, the lover sea).

The bone-ache deep, the pains gone unexplained:
for now just dive, ameliorator sea.

The “mermaid’s tears,” smoothed glass or plastic: lovely
but hazardous to creatures of the sea.

This evening’s rough: Poseidon snaps my straps.
Pathetic fallacy, bipolar sea.

And in their one-piece suits, the ladies age
and silver, laugh and rage: September sea.

For whatever we lose(like a you or a me)
it’s always ourselves we find in the sea.",Moira Egan,ghazal
Swan Song,"They say when the time comes for a swan to die,
it goes where other swans have gone to die.

They say as the last night begins to fall,
it trails behind the setting sun to die.

And it sings ghazals, as though it wished between
the pages of its own divan to die.

They say a swan loves only once and will
return to where its love was won to die.

Making its deathbed where it first made love,
it can forget it has withdrawn to die.

Are these tales true? In the desert, where I live,
no swan has come, not a single one, to die.

But then they say that swans return to water,
in whose embrace life was begun, to die.

Open your arms, my dear, and slake my thirst:
the time has come for one more swan to die.",Armen Davoudian,ghazal
Ghazal of Oranges,"On New Year’s Eve, my father overfills the baskets with oranges,
mangoes, grapes, grapefruits, other citrus too, but mostly oranges.

The morning of the first, he opens every window to let the new year in.
In Chinatown, red bags sag with mustard greens and mandarin oranges.

A farmer in a fallow season kneels to know the dirt. More silt than soil,
he wipes his brow and mumbles to his dog: time to give up this crop of oranges.

The woman knows she let herself say too much to someone undeserving.
She lays her penance on her sister’s doorstep: a case of expensive oranges.

At the Whitney, I take a photo of a poem in a book behind the glass.
Above it, a painting: smears of blue, Frank O’Hara, his messy oranges.

The handsome server speaks with his hands: Tonight is grilled octopus
with braised fennel and olives, topped with peppercress, cara caras, and blood oranges.

No one at the table looks up, ashamed by the prices on the chic menus.
The busser fills my water and I inhale him: his faraway scent of oranges.

Seventh grade, Southern California: we monitored the daily smog alerts.
Red: stay inside. White: play outside. I forget what warning orange is.

Clutch was serious about art and said our final projects could be
whatever . . . performative . . . like, just show up with a wheelbarrow full of oranges.

Jan, in all of those first six years, why is all you can remember this:

What of Fire?,"My therapist has approved my drinking of three whiskeys per night,
her eyes forbearing, knowing well the ruthlessness of night.

The sun having fled as a father might flee, my cousin fathered
a narrow terror while he robbed, with a pistol, a fellow citizen one night.

The encouraging lies of a mother are greatly underpaid job-keepers;
slovenly kings have dealt much wrong money to generals and knights.

My childhood was a lengthy scene of make believe and disaccord—
my favorite things being rain and watching my mother’s cigarettes ignite.

What of fire, among its timelessness and musculature, is not
more divine when burning past the open gates of night?",Marcus Jackson,ghazal
Ghazal !,"A lot more malaise and a little more grief every day,

aware that all seasons, the stormy, the sunlit, are brief every day. 

I don’t know the name of the hundredth drowned child, just the names

of the oligarchs trampling the green, eating beef every day,

while luminous creatures flick, stymied, above and around

the plastic detritus that’s piling up over the reef every day.

A tiny white cup of black coffee in afternoon shade,

while an oud or a sax plays brings breath and relief every day. 

Another beginning, no useful conclusion in sight‚—

another first draft that I tear out and add to the sheaf every day. 

One name, three-in-one, ninety-nine, or a matrix of tales

Vindication,"They signed The Declaration of Sentiments

Called ugly then witch, pretty then weak

Hunger, headaches, heartaches, hatred, death

all this, and more, it cost them, their daring

As men are born, with God’s grace, so are women

they urged and argued with brains and daring

With firm convictions and hopes of fallen yokes

steadfast they marched nursing dreams of future daring

Ghazal,"The sky is a dry pitiless white. The wide rows stretch on into death.
Like famished birds, my hands strip each stalk of its stolen crop: our name.
History is a ship forever setting sail. On either shore: mountains of men,
Oceans of bone, an engine whose teeth shred all that is not our name.

Can you imagine what will sound from us, what we’ll rend and claim
When we find ourselves alone with all we’ve ever sought: our name?

Or perhaps what we seek lives outside of speech, like a tribe of goats
On a mountain above a lake, whose hooves nick away at rock. Our name

Is blown from tree to tree, scattered by the breeze. Who am I to say what,
In that marriage, is lost? For all I know, the grass has caught our name.

Having risen from moan to growl, growl to a hound’s low bray,
The voices catch. No priest, no sinner has yet been taught our name.

Will it thunder up, the call of time? Or lie quiet as bedrock beneath
Our feet? Our name our name our name our fraught, fraught name.",Tracy K. Smith,ghazal
Reservoirs,"The apple was not an apple when the rains came

First the river wouldn’t fill             Then the valley’s hills
rose like the back of a camel when the rains came

The piano pursed its mouth of strings      The tenor kissed
his weathered hymnal when the rains came

There was no weathered landscape           there were neither
the hanging gardens nor Babel when the rains came

Lying on his back            the shepherd fanned his arms and legs

Cast-Iron Ghazal,"My mouth won’t ever forget her skill with a skillet,
my father’s mother, cooking
with her mother’s skillet.

Looking deep into its heavy antique mirror, I see
her wedding day: white dress
and this coal-dark skillet.

Heaven was bacon’s sizzle waking my ears and nose.
Or was it one of her chickens 
slow-frying in the skillet?

Her husband once took it hunting without asking:
she said she’d bust his skull 
with that upraised skillet.

Fire-born bell whose clapper was a plain dinner fork,
juicy fauna and flora notes
rang out from her skillet.

I see early widowhood, cooked-for children gone:
darkness lends its seasoning
to every cast-iron skillet.

She hid its teardrop handle inside her strong grip
when pouring red-eye gravy
from one lip of the skillet.

What went into the oven as batter we two mixed
came out as cornbread glory,
steaming amen in a skillet.

Black as her Bible, black as her once-maiden hair,
black as a panther howling
at midnight, this skillet.

I see her funeral day, the kitchen filled with food
not made by her, no flame
kissing the empty skillet.

“When the dark times come, we will sing about the dark times.”

They’ll always be wrong about peace when they’re wrong about justice…
Were you wrong, were you right, insisting about the dark times?

The traditional fears, the habitual tropes of exclusion
Like ominous menhirs, close into their ring about the dark times.

Naysayers in sequins or tweeds, libertine or ascetic
Find a sensual frisson in what they’d call bling about the dark times.

Some of the young can project themselves into a Marshall Plan future
Where they laugh and link arms, reminiscing about the dark times.

From every spot-lit glitz tower with armed guards around it
Some huckster pronounces his fiats, self-sacralized king, about the dark times.

In a tent, in a queue, near barbed wire, in a shipping container,
Please remember ya akhy, we too know something about the dark times.

maybe I was right about America

She smiles as guilty as a bride without blood, her love
of this new country, cold snow & naked american men.

“Stop living in a soap opera” yells her husband, fresh
from work, demanding his dinner: american. Men

take & take & yet you idolize them still, watch

The Ghazal of What Hurt,"Pain froze you, for years—and fear—leaving scars. 
But now, as though miraculously, it seems, here you are

as though you were floating on air, which in part you are, 

or riding a wave of what feels like the world's good will—
though helped along by something foreign and older than you are 

and yet much younger too, inside you, and so palpable 
an X-ray, you're sure, would show it, within the body you are,
 
not all that far beneath the skin, and even in 
some bones. Making you wonder: Are you what you are—

with all that isn't actually you having flowed 
through and settled in you, and made you what you are? 

The pain was never replaced, nor was it quite erased. 
It's memory now—so you know just how lucky you are. 

You didn't always. Were you then? And where's the fear?
Inside your words, like an engine? The car you are?! 

Face it, friend, you most exist when you're driven 
away, or on—by forms and forces greater than you are. ",Peter Cole,ghazal

The sound I make is sympathy's:  sad dogs are tied afar.
But howling I become an ever more un-
heard person.

I need a hundred more of you to make a likelihood.
The mirror's not convincing-- that at-best in-
ferred person.

As time's revealing gets revolting, I start looking out.
Look in and what you see is one unholy
blurred person.

The only cure for birth one doesn't love to contemplate.

The Weary Blues,"Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
     I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
     He did a lazy sway . . .
     He did a lazy sway . . .
To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.
     O Blues!
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
     Sweet Blues!
Coming from a black man’s soul.
     O Blues!
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—
     ""Ain’t got nobody in all this world,
       Ain’t got nobody but ma self.
       I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’
       And put ma troubles on the shelf.""

Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords then he sang some more—
     ""I got the Weary Blues
       And I can’t be satisfied.
       Got the Weary Blues
       And can’t be satisfied—
       I ain’t happy no mo’
       And I wish that I had died.""
And far into the night he crooned that tune.
The stars went out and so did the moon.

While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.
He slept like a rock or a man that's dead.",Langston Hughes,blues poem

but love you more.
And there ain’t
gonna be
any more
sad parties
between us two
because I’m
gonna forget
what I want
till I see
what I want
is you.
And I ain’t
gonna find
what you are
till I find
what it is
that you want
of me
and how
am I
gonna see
what it is
till all
of myself
loves you.
And I don’t
really love
you though I
love you more
than the world
till I learn
to swallow
whatever
you’d like
me to do.
And I ain’t
gonna down
whatever
that little
may be
till I love
me less and
love you more
and love you
for yourself
alone.
If there ain’t
gonna be
any loving
just you
alone
then it’s up
to me to
be taking
myself and
moving myself
off home.
And I’ll
be dragging
what’s left of me
to my lonely
room in the blue
and never
come back
and never
crawl back
till I’m through
just hugging
me.
And I ain’t
no I ain’t
gonna stop
doing that as
I ought to do
till I’m ab-
solutely and
positively
in love and
in love with
you.
And when I’ve
done that and
done only that
and done all of that
for you
you’ll hear me
on the doorstep
ringing at the
doorbell
for one more
party for two.
With nothing
mad in it
nothing sad
in it but
a long glad
lifelong spree
with me myself
loving you yourself
and you
loving me
for me.",Alfred Kreymborg,blues poem
Blues Franchise,"Blues as art as theme as exhibition

Up on a midtown metropolis edifice

Billboard façade 50 feet tall thirty feet wide: BLUE SMOKE

Of a black femme-like face framed by her fingers tapered upward in the V of her palms

Looking off, her eyes below her painted on eyebrows

And Caucasoid wig solid black

touching off of a violet plunging deeper into the decorated pigment

A frame furls hints of blue in a spectral geometry

Framing tightly the face, reposed

A white strap over one deep ochre shoulder as background

 
Could be trans-shim or a delightful Caledonia,

red skein of a lipstick kiss imprinted invisibly in a nano dimension

 
Replications across the marquees of legions of subway cars

Her face on the mini billboard above the seat next to

The moving doors

Always looking somewhere else as the

Masses travel to all destinations

Blues smoke surrounding whatever stage as forum

For the franchise

Forever after for as far as the past goes.

 
Entering the negative space of a corporate behemoth

A lobby of the skyscraper museum or loft like enclosures

interlocking directorates of high art residencies.

 
Consumer beware of what you purchase with your eyes,

The presence of your body

Out of the blue

You

Out of the blue

And into the blues

Out of the blue

Out of the blue

Incognito Grief: A Blues,"Who knows the secrets in my gaze?
What holds me back when I might choke?
Who sees beyond my taut hellos
To see the grief etched on my face?
Nobody knows what lurks within;
Nobody brings me back again.
Who needs to disappear for a while?
Who sings my name beyond the veil?
Who has my memories, my tales?
Who’s lurking in my carpet’s dust?
Nobody feels this weight beneath my skin.
Who knows I’m grieving as I walk?
Who has the list of gravity’s costs?
Nobody but the man I’ve lost.",Allison Joseph,blues poem
Come On in the Song of the Changes,"it’s the listener determine what it is

the sound of your thoughts’ running come on
baby don’t you want to     go —

and everything pulls over to the side
traffic lights stop sayin’ what they sayin’

and suddenly sally ride sally’s ride
right on    by —

peoples wives and children disappear    out of nowhere
some drive their gold teeth back home  a deepened run in gear.

if you willing to let rain scare you to.

its belly purses fat       full or not —    the song

you better    come on in that kitchen.

that siren not a devil    that mercy seat less
savior    than common sense calling you to right

your seating rather than fall over your chair

to pay attention       to the ground your standing come on in",Ed Roberson,blues poem
Poem,"Little brown boy,
Slim, dark, big-eyed,
Crooning love songs to your banjo
Down at the Lafayette—
Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head,
High sort of and a bit to one side,
Like a prince, a jazz prince. And I love
Your eyes flashing, and your hands,
And your patent-leathered feet,
And your shoulders jerking the jig-wa.
And I love your teeth flashing,
And the way your hair shines in the spotlight
Like it was the real stuff.
Gee, brown boy, I loves you all over.
I’m glad I’m a jig. I’m glad I can
Understand your dancin’ and your
Singin’, and feel all the happiness
And joy and don’t care in you.
Gee, boy, when you sing, I can close my ears
And hear tom toms just as plain.
Listen to me, will you, what do I know
About tom toms? But I like the word, sort of,
Don’t you? It belongs to us.
Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head,
And the way you sing, and dance,
And everything.
Say, I think you’re wonderful. You’re
Allright with me,
You are.",Helene Johnson,blues poem

All the Time Blues Villanelle,"Hard to watch somebody lose their mind
Maybe everybody    should just go get stoned
My father said it happens all the time

I knew a woman    lost her to soul to wine
But who doesn’t live with their life on loan?
Shame to watch somebody lose their mind

Don’tchu gotta wonder when people say they’re fine?
Given what we’re given, I guess they actin grown
I think I used to say that      all the time

When my parents died, I coined a little shrine
And thought about all the stuff they used to own
Felt like I was gonna lose my mind

Used to have a friend    who smiled all the time
Then he started sayin he could hear the devil moan
Hate to see a brotha lose his gotdam mind

Doesn’t matter how you pull, the hours break the line
Mirror, Mirror on the wall, how come nobody’s home?
Broke my soul for real, when my mother lost her mind

Tried to keep my head right, but sanity’s a climb
Been workin on the straight face—I guess my cover’s blown
My father tried to tell me     all the time

Had one last question, baby, but maybe never mind
After’while, even springtime starts to drone

Hard to see somebody lose their mind
My pop said, “Boy, it happens all the time”",Tim Seibles,blues poem

boy traveling
with empty belly;

shanties, and fine
big houses, a sad
song
on a poor man’s tongue
land of cotton and trouble
night sweet as dusk
on its gentle people
until today,
when

where the train
had to stop
and the Southern

was beautiful

from Memphis to Georgia
drinking my whiskey

Riverbank Blues,"A man git his feet set in a sticky mudbank,
A man git dis yellow water in his blood,
No need for hopin', no need for doin',
Muddy streams keep him fixed for good.

Little Muddy, Big Muddy, Moreau and Osage,
Little Mary's, Big Mary's, Cedar Creek,
Flood deir muddy water roundabout a man's roots,
Keep him soaked and stranded and git him weak.

Lazy sun shinin' on a little cabin,
Lazy moon glistenin' over river trees;
Ole river whisperin', lappin' 'gainst de long roots:
""Plenty of rest and peace in these . . .""

Big mules, black loam, apple and peach trees,
But seems lak de river washes us down
Past de rich farms, away from de fat lands,
Dumps us in some ornery riverbank town.

Went down to the river, sot me down an' listened,
Heard de water talkin' quiet, quiet lak an' slow:
""Ain' no need fo' hurry, take yo' time, take yo'
time . . ."" Heard it sayin'—""Baby, hyeahs de way life go . . .""

Dat is what it tole me as I watched it slowly rollin',
But somp'n way inside me rared up an' say,
""Better be movin' . . . better be travelin' . . .
Riverbank'll git you ef you stay . . .""

Towns are sinkin' deeper, deeper in de riverbank,
Takin' on de ways of deir sulky Ole Man—
Takin' on his creepy ways, takin' on his evil ways,
""Bes' git way, a long way . . . whiles you can. Man got his
sea too lak de Mississippi Ain't got so long for a whole lot longer way,
Man better move some, better not git rooted Muddy water fool you, ef you stay . . .""",Sterling A. Brown,blues poem
"Go Down, Death","(A Funeral Sermon)

Weep not, weep not,
She is not dead;
She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.
Heart-broken husband—weep no more;
Grief-stricken son—weep no more;
Left-lonesome daughter—weep no more;
She only just gone home.

Day before yesterday morning,
God was looking down from his great, high heaven,
Looking down on all his children,
And his eye fell on Sister Caroline,
Tossing on her bed of pain.
And God’s big heart was touched with pity,
With the everlasting pity.

And God sat back on his throne,
And he commanded that tall, bright angel standing at his right hand:
Call me Death!
And that tall, bright angel cried in a voice
That broke like a clap of thunder:
Call Death!—Call Death!
And the echo sounded down the streets of heaven
Till it reached away back to that shadowy place,
Where Death waits with his pale, white horses.

And Death heard the summons,
And he leaped on his fastest horse,
Pale as a sheet in the moonlight.
Up the golden street Death galloped,
And the hooves of his horses struck fire from the gold,
But they didn’t make no sound.
Up Death rode to the Great White Throne,
And waited for God’s command.

And God said: Go down, Death, go down,
Go down to Savannah, Georgia,
Down in Yamacraw,
And find Sister Caroline.
She’s borne the burden and heat of the day,
She’s labored long in my vineyard,
And she’s tired—
She’s weary—
Go down, Death, and bring her to me.

And Death didn’t say a word,
But he loosed the reins on his pale, white horse,
And he clamped the spurs to his bloodless sides,
And out and down he rode,
Through heaven’s pearly gates,
Past suns and moons and stars;
on Death rode,
Leaving the lightning’s flash behind;
Straight down he came.

While we were watching round her bed,
She turned her eyes and looked away,
She saw what we couldn’t see;
She saw Old Death. She saw Old Death
Coming like a falling star.
But Death didn't frighten Sister Caroline;
He looked to her like a welcome friend.
And she whispered to us: I’m going home,
And she smiled and closed her eyes.

And Death took her up like a baby,
And she lay in his icy arms,
But she didn’t feel no chill.
And death began to ride again—
Up beyond the evening star,
Into the glittering light of glory,
On to the Great White Throne.
And there he laid Sister Caroline
On the loving breast of Jesus.

And Jesus took his own hand and wiped away her tears,
And he smoothed the furrows from her face,
And the angels sang a little song,
And Jesus rocked her in his arms,
And kept a-saying: Take your rest,
Take your rest.

Weep not—weep not,
She is not dead;
She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.",James Weldon Johnson,blues poem
I’m a Fool to Love You,"Some folks will tell you the blues is a woman,
Some type of supernatural creature.
My mother would tell you, if she could,
About her life with my father,
A strange and sometimes cruel gentleman.
She would tell you about the choices
A young black woman faces.
Is falling in with some man
A deal with the devil
In blue terms, the tongue we use
When we don’t want nuance
To get in the way,
When we need to talk straight?
My mother chooses my father
After choosing a man
Who was, as we sing it,
Of no account.
This man made my father look good,
That’s how bad it was.
He made my father seem like an island
In the middle of a stormy sea,
He made my father look like a rock.
And is the blues the moment you realize
You exist in a stacked deck,
You look in a mirror at your young face,
The face my sister carries,
And you know it’s the only leverage
You’ve got?
Does this create a hurt that whispers
How you going to do?
Is the blues the moment
You shrug your shoulders 
And agree, a girl without money
Is nothing, dust 
To be pushed around by any old breeze? 
Compared to this,
My father seems, briefly,
To be a fire escape.
This is the way the blues works
Its sorry wonders,
Makes trouble look like
A feather bed,
Makes the wrong man’s kisses
A healing.
",Cornelius Eady,blues poem
