[Weaned from life and flown away],"Weaned from life and flown away
In the morning of thy day, 
Bound in everlasting gloom, 
Buried in a hapless tomb.

Yet upon thy bended knee 
Thank the power that banished thee; 
Chain and bar and dungeon wall 
Saved thee from a deadlier thrall.

Thank the power that made thee part 
Ere that parting broke thy heart. 
Wildly rushed the mountain spring 
From its source of fern and ling; 
How invincible its roar, 
Had its waters worn the shore.",Emily Brontë,sonnet,,,,
Of Love: A Sonnet,"How love came in I do not know,
Whether by the eye, or ear, or no;
Or whether with the soul it came
(At first) infused with the same;
Whether in part ’tis here or there,
Or, like the soul, whole everywhere,
This troubles me: but I as well
As any other this can tell:
That when from hence she does depart
The outlet then is from the heart.",Robert Herrick,sonnet,Sonnet,"This poem is a sonnet because it adheres to a concise lyrical form that debates or meditates on a single theme, which in this case is the mysterious nature of love and its origins. While it does not strictly follow the 14-line structure associated with a traditional sonnet, it shares the contemplative tone and the exploration of a philosophical idea often found in sonnets. This compact meditation aligns more with the sonnet tradition rather than the other forms listed.",Contemplation,0.68
"Sonnet XLIV [For Thee the Sun Doth Daily Rise, and Set] ","For thee the sun doth daily rise, and set 
Behind the curtain of the hills of sleep,

Broods on thy love, and never can forget.  
For thee the garlands of the wood are wet,  
For thee the daisies up the meadow’s sweep 
Stir in the sidelong light, and for thee weep 
The drooping ferns above the violet.  
For thee the labour of my studious ease 
I ply with hope, for thee all pleasures please,  
Thy sweetness doth the bread of sorrow leaven;  
And from thy noble lips and heart of gold 
I drink the comfort of the faiths of old,  
Any thy perfection is my proof of heaven.",George Santayana,sonnet,,,,
That you were once unkind befriends me now (Sonnet 120),"That you were once unkind befriends me now,
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow,
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer’d steel.
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
As I by yours, you’ve pass’d a hell of time,
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffer’d in your crime.
O, that our night of woe might have remember’d
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,

Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?,"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;

On the Extinction of the Venetian Republic,"Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee;
And was the safeguard of the west: the worth
Of Venice did not fall below her birth,
Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.
She was a maiden City, bright and free;
No guile seduced, no force could violate;
And, when she took unto herself a Mate,
She must espouse the everlasting Sea.
And what if she had seen those glories fade,
Those titles vanish, and that strength decay;
Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
When her long life hath reached its final day:
Men are we, and must grieve when even the Shade
Of that which once was great is passed away.",William Wordsworth,sonnet,Sonnet,"This poem is a sonnet because it has 14 lines, written in iambic pentameter, and follows a rhyme scheme reminiscent of a Petrarchan or modified sonnet (ABBAABBACDCDCD).

Sonnet VIII,"Mondego! thou, whose waters cold and clear 
Gird those green banks, where fancy fain would stay, 
Fondly to muse on that departed day 
When Hope was kind and Friendship seem’d sincere; 
—Ere I had purchas’d knowledge with a tear.
—Mondego! though I bend my pilgrim way 
To other shores, where other fountains stray,
And other rivers roll their proud career, 
Still—nor shall time, nor grief, nor stars severe, 
Nor widening distance e’er prevail in aught 
To make thee less to this sad bosom dear; 
And Memory oft, by old Affection taught, 
Shall lightly speed upon the plumes of thought, 
To bathe amongst thy waters cold and clear!

Unstable Dream,"Unstable dream, according to the place,
Be steadfast once, or else at least be true.

But madest my sprite live, my care to renew,
My body in tempest her succour to embrace.

Painless was th'one, th'other in delight.

Sonnet XCI [I can in groups these mimic flowers compose],"Reflections on Some Drawings of Plants

  Or the pale Iris cloud with veins of blue; 
Copy the scallop’d leaves, and downy stems, 
  And bid the pencil’s varied shades arrest 
Spring’s humid buds, and Summer’s musky gems: 
  But, save the portrait on my bleeding breast, 
I have no semblance of that form adored, 
  That form, expressive of a soul divine, 
  So early blighted, and while life is mine, 
With fond regret, and ceaseless grief deplored—

Modern Love: XXXVI,"My Lady unto Madam makes her bow.

My Lady’s nose of Nature might complain.
It is not fashioned aptly to express
Her character of large-browed steadfastness.

Hums by us with the honey of the Spring,
And showers of sweet notes from the larks on wing,
Are dropping like a noon-dew, wander we.

And friendly shadows dance upon her brow.

To challenge eyesight? Now, as then, the grace
Of heaven seems holding earth in its embrace.

There is also a rhyme (*qafia*) before the refrain, with examples like ""knot / bought,"" ""dark / forgot,"" and ""house / what."" Additionally, the final couplet includes the poet's name or signature, as traditional ghazals often conclude with a reference to the poet (in this case, ""Shahid""). The themes of sorrow, love, memory, and longing are central to the ghazal tradition and are evident throughout this poem.",Refrain,1.0
Orange,"If I have a gender, let it be a history learned from orange
Freak            Sun Sucker           Queer            Orange Boy

Rumor of 6th grade sunrise, dressed in you I was a child
of unspeakable obsession. Archaic language, Giolureade

Until Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scots. Her lips unlocked
your sarcenet line, my fingers knew taste before the orange

Dared on Norwood apartments, Dutch colonies
hunted man straight into your family crests of orange

Scraped from dust to crown our bruises, warriors we
stared directly into the sun, Tainos dyed in orange

As if we always knew we were history. Amber hardened into gold
tricking mortals, mortals tricking gods asking Was it the fruit or the color?

First, Tibbets’ grove, millions of fruits grafted
instead of born, from two parent orange trees

The key to a philosopher’s stone: Colormen flirting
with volcanos to retrieve your arsenic orpiment

Forever in danger of sliding into another color, I ran
after you, tracing rivers and creeks and streams of citrus

The Washington Navel Orange, a second fruit protruding:
not a twin, nor translation, but a new name every season.",Noel Quiñones,ghazal,,,,
Ghazal Circling Fatherhood,"My mother exalts her long-gone father.
Driving home, laments the failings of my father.

Sees her ex-husband in my excuses,
tells me: That’s just like your father. 

On holiday, he sneaks away to work;
I take a work call. Like son, like father.

Before, I tried to outrun my shadow
when sun met twilight, like Earth’s late father.

God sacrificed his son for his life’s work.
So we sing heavenward to honor the Father,

the Son, and the Holy Spirit—Forgive me,
for I have sinned, become my own father—

not who raised me, but those who claim me
as theirs. The stone-jawed men who father

havoc through absence, posture a myth for
any gaze. How many don’t know their father?

I’m at my kids’ school, bath time, rubbing their backs
before bed. They will know their father

as the one who showed up & always stayed,
bleary-eyed, did anything to father.

My mother fears she will be forgotten,
invoking Time, like others, as a father.

My wife notes the shifting sky above us.
What gravity gives birth to a father?",Carlos Andrés Gómez,ghazal,,,,
Ghazal: Sea,"As Karen Blixen said, the cure’s the sea
—or sweat, or tears—but I prefer the sea.

In fact, it’s homeopathy. Why cry
with eyes baptised (if reddened) by the sea?

The metaphors of fabric come to mind:
cool silk or aqua velvet, summer sea

            (or better, come to body: intimate,
            enveloped skin on skin, the lover sea).

The bone-ache deep, the pains gone unexplained:
for now just dive, ameliorator sea.

The “mermaid’s tears,” smoothed glass or plastic: lovely
but hazardous to creatures of the sea.

This evening’s rough: Poseidon snaps my straps.
Pathetic fallacy, bipolar sea.

And in their one-piece suits, the ladies age
and silver, laugh and rage: September sea.

For whatever we lose(like a you or a me)
it’s always ourselves we find in the sea.",Moira Egan,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the structural pattern and thematic elements commonly associated with the form. Each couplet in the poem stands as an independent unit, with the final word or phrase of the second line of each couplet repeating a rhyming scheme, highlighting the refrain: ""the sea."" Ghazals are often marked by themes of longing, loss, and emotional intensity, all of which are present in this poem's meditative exploration of the sea as a metaphor for healing, transformation, and self-discovery. Moreover, the poem uses both the formal refrains and a reflective tone that links the couplets while maintaining their autonomy.",Refrain,0.97
Swan Song,"They say when the time comes for a swan to die,
it goes where other swans have gone to die.

They say as the last night begins to fall,
it trails behind the setting sun to die.

And it sings ghazals, as though it wished between
the pages of its own divan to die.

They say a swan loves only once and will
return to where its love was won to die.

Making its deathbed where it first made love,
it can forget it has withdrawn to die.

Are these tales true? In the desert, where I live,
no swan has come, not a single one, to die.

But then they say that swans return to water,
in whose embrace life was begun, to die.

Open your arms, my dear, and slake my thirst:
the time has come for one more swan to die.",Armen Davoudian,ghazal,,,,
Ghazal of Oranges,"On New Year’s Eve, my father overfills the baskets with oranges,
mangoes, grapes, grapefruits, other citrus too, but mostly oranges.

The morning of the first, he opens every window to let the new year in.
In Chinatown, red bags sag with mustard greens and mandarin oranges.

A farmer in a fallow season kneels to know the dirt. More silt than soil,
he wipes his brow and mumbles to his dog: time to give up this crop of oranges.

The woman knows she let herself say too much to someone undeserving.
She lays her penance on her sister’s doorstep: a case of expensive oranges.

At the Whitney, I take a photo of a poem in a book behind the glass.
Above it, a painting: smears of blue, Frank O’Hara, his messy oranges.

The handsome server speaks with his hands: Tonight is grilled octopus
with braised fennel and olives, topped with peppercress, cara caras, and blood oranges.

No one at the table looks up, ashamed by the prices on the chic menus.
The busser fills my water and I inhale him: his faraway scent of oranges.

Seventh grade, Southern California: we monitored the daily smog alerts.
Red: stay inside. White: play outside. I forget what warning orange is.

Clutch was serious about art and said our final projects could be
whatever . . . performative . . . like, just show up with a wheelbarrow full of oranges.

Jan, in all of those first six years, why is all you can remember this:
the mist rising in the sunny air as you watched her peeling oranges.",Jan-Henry Gray,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it adheres to the traditional form of using couplets (shers) that are self-contained but united by a recurring refrain (“oranges”) at the end of the second line of each couplet. This refrain serves as a central motif throughout the poem and provides cohesion, which is a defining feature of the ghazal form. The poem also incorporates diverse and disparate images to create emotional resonance while circling back to the theme, another hallmark of the ghazal tradition. Furthermore, the poet inserts their name (“Jan”) in the last couplet, which is a common characteristic of traditional ghazals (called ""takhallus"").",Refrain,0.98
What of Fire?,"My therapist has approved my drinking of three whiskeys per night,
her eyes forbearing, knowing well the ruthlessness of night.

The sun having fled as a father might flee, my cousin fathered
a narrow terror while he robbed, with a pistol, a fellow citizen one night.

The encouraging lies of a mother are greatly underpaid job-keepers;
slovenly kings have dealt much wrong money to generals and knights.

My childhood was a lengthy scene of make believe and disaccord—
my favorite things being rain and watching my mother’s cigarettes ignite.

What of fire, among its timelessness and musculature, is not
more divine when burning past the open gates of night?",Marcus Jackson,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the traditional structure of couplets (sher), with each couplet being self-contained and thematically complete. There is also a repetitive use of a refrain phrase or word (""of night""/""the night"") at the end of the second line in many couplets, which is a characteristic feature of ghazals. Additionally, the tone and themes, such as longing, personal strife, and exploration of universal truths like night and fire, resonate with the introspective and philosophical nature of the ghazal form.",Refrain,0.95
Ghazal !,"A lot more malaise and a little more grief every day,

aware that all seasons, the stormy, the sunlit, are brief every day. 

I don’t know the name of the hundredth drowned child, just the names

of the oligarchs trampling the green, eating beef every day,

while luminous creatures flick, stymied, above and around

the plastic detritus that’s piling up over the reef every day.

A tiny white cup of black coffee in afternoon shade,

while an oud or a sax plays brings breath and relief every day. 

Another beginning, no useful conclusion in sight‚—

another first draft that I tear out and add to the sheaf every day. 

One name, three-in-one, ninety-nine, or a matrix of tales 

that are one story only, well-springs of belief every day.

But I wake before dawn to read news that arrived overnight

on a minuscule screen , and exclaim  ?? ???? every day.",Marilyn Hacker,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it adheres to the traditional structure and themes of the form. Each couplet stands alone as an independent thematic unit, yet the repeating refrain (""every day"") creates a unifying thread throughout the poem. Furthermore, the poem employs a radif (repeating phrase at the end of the second line of each couplet) and maintains the use of a monorhyme scheme before the radif, which are hallmark features of ghazal construction. The themes of despair, fleeting beauty, and existential reflection tie into the often philosophical or emotional focus of a ghazal.",Refrain,0.95
Vindication,"They signed The Declaration of Sentiments

with nib of rib, the right to suffrage their daring

Called ugly then witch, pretty then weak

to be at once woman and voter, their daring

Hunger, headaches, heartaches, hatred, death

As men are born, with God’s grace, so are women

they urged and argued with brains and daring

With firm convictions and hopes of fallen yokes

There is more work on the horizon, more

yeast to knead into the bread of their daring

Persist Claudia! in mind and body be

not ugly, not pretty, but ablaze with daring.",Claudia Castro Luna,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the conventions of this form—composed of loosely connected couplets, each of which ends with the same refrain (""their daring""). The repetition of the refrain is a defining feature of the ghazal form, and the poet inserts their name or identity (""Claudia"") in the final couplet, which is another hallmark of a traditional ghazal. The poem also includes a reflective tone and focuses on themes of persistence and resistance, which resonate deeply with the ghazal's roots in expressing longing and resilience.",Refrain,0.95
Ghazal,"The sky is a dry pitiless white. The wide rows stretch on into death.
Like famished birds, my hands strip each stalk of its stolen crop: our name.
History is a ship forever setting sail. On either shore: mountains of men,
Oceans of bone, an engine whose teeth shred all that is not our name.

Can you imagine what will sound from us, what we’ll rend and claim
When we find ourselves alone with all we’ve ever sought: our name?

Or perhaps what we seek lives outside of speech, like a tribe of goats
On a mountain above a lake, whose hooves nick away at rock. Our name

Is blown from tree to tree, scattered by the breeze. Who am I to say what,
In that marriage, is lost? For all I know, the grass has caught our name.

Having risen from moan to growl, growl to a hound’s low bray,
The voices catch. No priest, no sinner has yet been taught our name.

Will it thunder up, the call of time? Or lie quiet as bedrock beneath
Our feet? Our name our name our name our fraught, fraught name.",Tracy K. Smith,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it utilizes the ghazal's traditional structure of couplets (shers), with the first couplet establishing a rhyme/refrain scheme (""our name"") that recurs in the second line of each following couplet. Additionally, the poem explores themes of identity, loss, and seeking, which are common in ghazals. The frequent repetition of ""our name"" at the end of many couplets aligns with the customary anchor in ghazals, while each couplet could stand alone as an independent thought or image. This independence, paired with the refrain's repetition, firmly connects this poem with the ghazal form.",Refrain,0.98
Reservoirs,"The apple was not an apple when the rains came
The grave spurned the groundskeeper’s shovel when the rains came

No sacrament    no scripture        There were no reservoirs
save an ark beneath the steeple when the rains came

First the river wouldn’t fill             Then the valley’s hills
rose like the back of a camel when the rains came

The piano pursed its mouth of strings      The tenor kissed
his weathered hymnal when the rains came

There was no weathered landscape           there were neither
the hanging gardens nor Babel when the rains came

Lying on his back            the shepherd fanned his arms and legs
No one told him he couldn’t impress an angel when the rains came

bride is greased and un-tongued, struck dumb by what’s at

Take that dare. Consummate. And then,

The poem is composed of a series of couplets (a significant feature of the ghazal form), with each couplet capable of standing on its own as a self-contained thought. Additionally, the repeated refrain ""again"" at the end of several couplets mirrors the radif, or refrain, typically found in ghazals, creating a thematic unity. The rhyme scheme before the refrain in adjacent couplets also reflects the monorhyme (qaafiya/rhyme before the refrain) structure commonly used. Furthermore, the poem contains a turn inward, with a reflective and often melancholic tone, which is a hallmark of the ghazal form. While the imagery is contemporary and political, the structure and thematic elements adhere closely to the conventions of a ghazal.",Refrain,0.95
Cast-Iron Ghazal,"My mouth won’t ever forget her skill with a skillet,
my father’s mother, cooking
with her mother’s skillet.

Looking deep into its heavy antique mirror, I see
her wedding day: white dress
and this coal-dark skillet.

Heaven was bacon’s sizzle waking my ears and nose.
Or was it one of her chickens 
slow-frying in the skillet?

Her husband once took it hunting without asking:
she said she’d bust his skull 
with that upraised skillet.

Fire-born bell whose clapper was a plain dinner fork,
juicy fauna and flora notes
rang out from her skillet.

I see early widowhood, cooked-for children gone:
darkness lends its seasoning
to every cast-iron skillet.

She hid its teardrop handle inside her strong grip
when pouring red-eye gravy
from one lip of the skillet.

What went into the oven as batter we two mixed
came out as cornbread glory,
steaming amen in a skillet.

Black as her Bible, black as her once-maiden hair,
black as a panther howling
at midnight, this skillet.

I see her funeral day, the kitchen filled with food
not made by her, no flame
kissing the empty skillet.

I say McFee into its circle, hear her savory voice 
giving back the family name 
from her (now my) skillet.",Michael McFee,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the traditional structure and thematic approach of the ghazal form. Each couplet is loosely self-contained yet thematically linked to the central focus on the skillet. The poem adheres to the ghazal’s typical repeated refrain, with ""skillet"" serving as the refrain at the end of each couplet. Additionally, the poem plays with rich imagery and emotional depth, exploring themes of memory, loss, and heritage, which are common in the ghazal tradition. The inclusion of the poet's name ""McFee"" in the final couplet serves as a takhallus, a traditional signature feature of the ghazal form.",Refrain,0.98

They’ll always be wrong about peace when they’re wrong about justice…
Were you wrong, were you right, insisting about the dark times?

The traditional fears, the habitual tropes of exclusion
Like ominous menhirs, close into their ring about the dark times.

Naysayers in sequins or tweeds, libertine or ascetic
Find a sensual frisson in what they’d call bling about the dark times.

Some of the young can project themselves into a Marshall Plan future
Where they laugh and link arms, reminiscing about the dark times.

From every spot-lit glitz tower with armed guards around it
Some huckster pronounces his fiats, self-sacralized king, about the dark times.

In a tent, in a queue, near barbed wire, in a shipping container,
Please remember ya akhy, we too know something about the dark times.

Sindbad’s roc, or Ganymede’s eagle, some bird of rapacious ill omen
From bleak skies descends, and wraps an enveloping wing about the dark times.

You come home from your meeting, your clinic, make coffee and look in the mirror
And ask yourself once more what you did to bring about the dark times.",Marilyn Hacker,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because of its use of a repeating refrain (""about the dark times"") at the end of each couplet, a defining characteristic of the ghazal form. Furthermore, the independent nature of the couplets, each acting as a self-contained thought or image while still tying into the central theme, aligns with the traditional structure of a ghazal. The first couplet introduces the rhyme and refrain, and subsequent couplets maintain the refrain, a hallmark feature of this form.",Refrain,0.95

or riding a wave of what feels like the world's good will—
though helped along by something foreign and older than you are 

and yet much younger too, inside you, and so palpable 
an X-ray, you're sure, would show it, within the body you are,
 
not all that far beneath the skin, and even in 
some bones. Making you wonder: Are you what you are—

with all that isn't actually you having flowed 
through and settled in you, and made you what you are? 

The pain was never replaced, nor was it quite erased. 
It's memory now—so you know just how lucky you are. 

You didn't always. Were you then? And where's the fear?
Inside your words, like an engine? The car you are?! 

Face it, friend, you most exist when you're driven 
away, or on—by forms and forces greater than you are. ",Peter Cole,ghazal,,,,

I was too young to be reasonable.

     He was so young, so unreasonable,
     He dipped weed in embalming fluid.

He'd dip our weed in embalming fluid.
We'd make love on trains and in dressing rooms.

     Love in the subway, love in mall restrooms.
     A bore at home, he transformed in the city.

What's yours at home is a wolf in my city.
You can't accuse me of sleeping with a man.",Jericho Brown,duplex,,,,
Duplex: Cento (p. 72),"My last love drove a burgundy car,
Color of a rash, a symptom of sickness.

     We were the symptoms, the road our sickness:
     None of our fights ended where they began.

None of the beaten end where they begin.
Any man in love can cause a messy corpse,

     But I didn't want to leave a messy corpse
     Obliterated in some lilied field,

Stench obliterating lilies of the field,
The murderer, young and unreasonable.

     He was so young, so unreasonable,
     Steadfast and awful, tall as my father.

Steadfast and awful, my tall father
Was my first love. He drove a burgundy car.",Jericho Brown,duplex,Duplex,"This poem is a duplex because it blends repetition and couplets in a way that follows the structure of the form. A duplex is a contemporary poetic form invented by Jericho Brown that combines elements of the sonnet, ghazal, and blues poem. The poem alternates between repetitive lines, creating a cyclical and interconnected narrative. The poem’s use of repeated lines, slight variations, and a circular structure (ending where it began) are hallmarks of the duplex.",Repetition,0.95
The Weary Blues,"Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
     I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
     He did a lazy sway . . .
     He did a lazy sway . . .
To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.
     O Blues!
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
     Sweet Blues!
Coming from a black man’s soul.
     O Blues!
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—
     ""Ain’t got nobody in all this world,
       Ain’t got nobody but ma self.
       I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’
       And put ma troubles on the shelf.""

Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords then he sang some more—
     ""I got the Weary Blues
       And I can’t be satisfied.
       Got the Weary Blues
       And can’t be satisfied—
       I ain’t happy no mo’
       And I wish that I had died.""
And far into the night he crooned that tune.
The stars went out and so did the moon.
The singer stopped playing and went to bed
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.
He slept like a rock or a man that's dead.",Langston Hughes,blues poem,,,,

Blues Franchise,"Blues as art as theme as exhibition

Up on a midtown metropolis edifice

Billboard façade 50 feet tall thirty feet wide: BLUE SMOKE

Of a black femme-like face framed by her fingers tapered upward in the V of her palms

Looking off, her eyes below her painted on eyebrows

And Caucasoid wig solid black

touching off of a violet plunging deeper into the decorated pigment

A frame furls hints of blue in a spectral geometry

Framing tightly the face, reposed

A white strap over one deep ochre shoulder as background

 
Could be trans-shim or a delightful Caledonia,

red skein of a lipstick kiss imprinted invisibly in a nano dimension

 
Replications across the marquees of legions of subway cars

Her face on the mini billboard above the seat next to

The moving doors

Always looking somewhere else as the

Masses travel to all destinations

Blues smoke surrounding whatever stage as forum

For the franchise

Forever after for as far as the past goes.

 
Entering the negative space of a corporate behemoth

A lobby of the skyscraper museum or loft like enclosures

interlocking directorates of high art residencies.

 
Consumer beware of what you purchase with your eyes,

The presence of your body

The poem uses these repetitions both as a structural and thematic device, echoing the blues song tradition of recurring lines that evoke a deep emotional resonance. The focus on a ""blue"" theme—both in color and metaphor—further aligns with the stylistic and tonal elements of blues poems. Themes of cultural identity and emotional depth (often tied to sorrow, struggle, or reflection) are prevalent, making ""blues poem"" the most fitting categorization.",Repetition,0.94

Nobody brings me back again.
Who needs to disappear for a while?
Who sings my name beyond the veil?
Who has my memories, my tales?
Who’s lurking in my carpet’s dust?
Nobody feels this weight beneath my skin.
Who knows I’m grieving as I walk?
Who has the list of gravity’s costs?
Nobody but the man I’ve lost.",Allison Joseph,blues poem,Ghazal,"This poem is a **ghazal** because it follows the most defining characteristic of the form: a series of couplets that are thematically linked but also capable of standing independently. Each couplet maintains its own complete idea while contributing to the overall theme of grief and loss. The repetition of the word ""Nobody"" functions similarly to the refrain (radif) seen in ghazals, and the reflective tone aligns with the traditional emotional resonance of the form.",Couplet,0.87

But who doesn’t live with their life on loan?
Shame to watch somebody lose their mind

Don’tchu gotta wonder when people say they’re fine?
Given what we’re given, I guess they actin grown
I think I used to say that      all the time

When my parents died, I coined a little shrine
And thought about all the stuff they used to own
Felt like I was gonna lose my mind

Used to have a friend    who smiled all the time
Then he started sayin he could hear the devil moan
Hate to see a brotha lose his gotdam mind

Doesn’t matter how you pull, the hours break the line
Mirror, Mirror on the wall, how come nobody’s home?
Broke my soul for real, when my mother lost her mind

Tried to keep my head right, but sanity’s a climb
Been workin on the straight face—I guess my cover’s blown

"Go Down, Death","(A Funeral Sermon)

Weep not, weep not,
She is not dead;
She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.
Heart-broken husband—weep no more;
Grief-stricken son—weep no more;
Left-lonesome daughter—weep no more;
She only just gone home.

Day before yesterday morning,
God was looking down from his great, high heaven,
Looking down on all his children,
And his eye fell on Sister Caroline,
Tossing on her bed of pain.
And God’s big heart was touched with pity,
With the everlasting pity.

And God sat back on his throne,
And he commanded that tall, bright angel standing at his right hand:
Call me Death!
And that tall, bright angel cried in a voice
That broke like a clap of thunder:
Call Death!—Call Death!
And the echo sounded down the streets of heaven
Till it reached away back to that shadowy place,
Where Death waits with his pale, white horses.

And Death heard the summons,
And he leaped on his fastest horse,
Pale as a sheet in the moonlight.
Up the golden street Death galloped,
And the hooves of his horses struck fire from the gold,
But they didn’t make no sound.
Up Death rode to the Great White Throne,
And waited for God’s command.

And God said: Go down, Death, go down,
Go down to Savannah, Georgia,
Down in Yamacraw,
And find Sister Caroline.
She’s borne the burden and heat of the day,
She’s labored long in my vineyard,
And she’s tired—
She’s weary—
Go down, Death, and bring her to me.

And Death didn’t say a word,
But he loosed the reins on his pale, white horse,
And he clamped the spurs to his bloodless sides,
And out and down he rode,
Through heaven’s pearly gates,
Past suns and moons and stars;
on Death rode,
Leaving the lightning’s flash behind;
Straight down he came.

While we were watching round her bed,
She turned her eyes and looked away,
She saw what we couldn’t see;
She saw Old Death. She saw Old Death
Coming like a falling star.
But Death didn't frighten Sister Caroline;
He looked to her like a welcome friend.
And she whispered to us: I’m going home,
And she smiled and closed her eyes.

And Death took her up like a baby,
And she lay in his icy arms,
But she didn’t feel no chill.
And death began to ride again—
Up beyond the evening star,
Into the glittering light of glory,
On to the Great White Throne.
And there he laid Sister Caroline
On the loving breast of Jesus.

And Jesus took his own hand and wiped away her tears,
And he smoothed the furrows from her face,
And the angels sang a little song,
And Jesus rocked her in his arms,
And kept a-saying: Take your rest,
Take your rest.

Weep not—weep not,
She is not dead;
She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.",James Weldon Johnson,blues poem,Blues Poem,"This poem aligns most closely with the ""blues poem"" form due to its use of repetition, a mournful tone, and its focus on loss and acceptance. The poem repeats phrases like ""Weep not, weep not"" and ""She is not dead,"" which mirrors the traditional call-and-response structure of blues poetry. The theme of mourning (and eventual resilience or consolation) is a hallmark of the blues form.

I’m a Fool to Love You,"Some folks will tell you the blues is a woman,
Some type of supernatural creature.
My mother would tell you, if she could,
About her life with my father,
A strange and sometimes cruel gentleman.
She would tell you about the choices
A young black woman faces.
Is falling in with some man
A deal with the devil
In blue terms, the tongue we use
When we don’t want nuance
To get in the way,
When we need to talk straight?
My mother chooses my father
After choosing a man
Who was, as we sing it,
Of no account.
This man made my father look good,
That’s how bad it was.
He made my father seem like an island
In the middle of a stormy sea,
He made my father look like a rock.
And is the blues the moment you realize
You exist in a stacked deck,
You look in a mirror at your young face,
The face my sister carries,
And you know it’s the only leverage
You’ve got?
Does this create a hurt that whispers
How you going to do?
Is the blues the moment
You shrug your shoulders 
And agree, a girl without money
Is nothing, dust 
To be pushed around by any old breeze? 
Compared to this,
My father seems, briefly,
To be a fire escape.
This is the way the blues works
Its sorry wonders,
Makes trouble look like
A feather bed,
Makes the wrong man’s kisses
A healing.
