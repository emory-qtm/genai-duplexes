[Weaned from life and flown away],"Weaned from life and flown away
In the morning of thy day, 
Bound in everlasting gloom, 
Buried in a hapless tomb.

Yet upon thy bended knee 
Thank the power that banished thee; 
Chain and bar and dungeon wall 
Saved thee from a deadlier thrall.

Thank the power that made thee part 
Ere that parting broke thy heart. 
Wildly rushed the mountain spring 
From its source of fern and ling; 
How invincible its roar, 
Had its waters worn the shore.",Emily Brontë,sonnet,Blues Poem,"This poem fits the structure of a blues poem due to its repetitive structure (repeating ""Thank the power"" and themes of suffering, redemption, and resilience), its use of personal lament and direct address, and its focus on overcoming hardship, all of which are characteristic of the blues form. The poem also employs a narrative arc that moves from despair to gratitude, a common feature in blues expression.",Redemption,0.87,False
Of Love: A Sonnet,"How love came in I do not know,
Whether by the eye, or ear, or no;
Or whether with the soul it came
(At first) infused with the same;
Whether in part ’tis here or there,
Or, like the soul, whole everywhere,
This troubles me: but I as well
As any other this can tell:
That when from hence she does depart
The outlet then is from the heart.",Robert Herrick,sonnet,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it features a consistent rhyme scheme (common in ghazals) and explores themes of love and longing, often with a reflective, slightly melancholic tone. The repeated refrain-like quality at the end of each couplet, and the questioning tone about the nature of love, align with the typical structure and spirit of the ghazal form, even if the provided poem is shorter than the traditional 14 couplets.",Reflection,0.87,False
"Sonnet XLIV [For Thee the Sun Doth Daily Rise, and Set] ","For thee the sun doth daily rise, and set

For thee the daisies up the meadow’s sweep 
Stir in the sidelong light, and for thee weep 
The drooping ferns above the violet.  
For thee the labour of my studious ease 
I ply with hope, for thee all pleasures please,

And from thy noble lips and heart of gold 
I drink the comfort of the faiths of old,  
Any thy perfection is my proof of heaven.",George Santayana,sonnet,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it is composed of couplets (two-line stanzas) with a consistent rhyme scheme, and it explores themes of love, devotion, and the beauty of the beloved’s influence on the speaker’s life. Ghazals typically feature this structure and an emphasis on longing and the divine or ideal beloved. While the poem does not explicitly use the traditional ""qafiʿ"" (closing stanza or pāṛa), its lyrical intensity and preoccupation with love align closely with the spirit of the ghazal form.",Devotion,0.89,False
That you were once unkind befriends me now (Sonnet 120),"That you were once unkind befriends me now,
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow,
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer’d steel.
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
As I by yours, you’ve pass’d a hell of time,
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffer’d in your crime.
O, that our night of woe might have remember’d
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
And soon to you, as you to me, then tender’d
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits!
    But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
    Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.",William Shakespeare,sonnet,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it exhibits the characteristic ghazal structure of couplets (usually in the form of two quatrains per stanza) linked by a central rhyming couplet (maqta‘), and it explores themes of regret, reconciliation, and emotional exchange—common in the genre. The poem moves between two speakers (the narrator and ""you""), and there is a thematic shift toward forgiveness and mutual suffering, which aligns with the reflective and often confessional tone of the ghazal. While the form is not strictly adhered to in the provided text (as the full structure is not shown), the rhyming scheme, thematic depth, and conversational tone are highly suggestive of the ghazal tradition.",Reciprocity,0.85,False
Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?,"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;

   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",William Shakespeare,sonnet,Sonnet,"This poem is a sonnet because it consists of 14 lines, follows a strict iambic pentameter meter (in most interpretations), and employs a consistent rhyme scheme (ABAB for the first eight lines, then a variant for the couplet), which are the defining features of a Shakespearean sonnet. The poem also explores themes of beauty, time, and immortality, which are common in sonnets.",Structure,0.98,False
"Sonnets from the Portuguese 20: Beloved, my Beloved, when I think","Beloved, my Beloved, when I think

Additionally, while the poem does not strictly follow the traditional division of couplets and a concluding panchayat (five-verse stanza), the overall structure and thematic content align closely with the conventions of the ghazal, particularly in its exploration of love, divine presence, and introspection.",Love,0.89,False
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault (Sonnet 89),"Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,

And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
    For thee against myself I’ll vow debate,
    For I must ne’er love him whom thou dost hate.",William Shakespeare,sonnet,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it consists of decoupled couplets (each pair of lines forms a ""patach"") linked by a thematic refrain or central idea, although the refrain is not explicitly stated here. The poem's tone is introspective and meditative, focusing on themes of love, betrayal, and internal conflict, which are hallmarks of the ghazal form. Additionally, the shift in perspective between the speaker and the beloved, as well as the nuanced use of rhyme and rhythm, are typical of ghazals. While the poem lacks an overt ""maqta' (punchline) or explicit ghazal markers, the structure of couplets and the lyrical exploration of emotional complexity suggest this form.",Reflection,0.89,False
On the Extinction of the Venetian Republic,"Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee;
And was the safeguard of the west: the worth
Of Venice did not fall below her birth,
Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.
She was a maiden City, bright and free;
No guile seduced, no force could violate;
And, when she took unto herself a Mate,
She must espouse the everlasting Sea.
And what if she had seen those glories fade,
Those titles vanish, and that strength decay;
Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
When her long life hath reached its final day:
Men are we, and must grieve when even the Shade
Of that which once was great is passed away.",William Wordsworth,sonnet,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it exhibits the characteristic ghazal structure of couplets (or tercets) linked by a consistent rhyme scheme, often with a thematic refrain or a focus on personal or philosophical reflection. While the provided poem is written in continuous prose, the references to lineage (""eldest Child of Liberty""), legacy (""heritage""), and the passage of time, as well as the contemplative tone, strongly align with the introspective, rhymed style typical of the ghazal form in both form and thematic content. The poem’s meditative mood, subtle allusions to historical figures (likely inspired by the historical Sultans of Venice), and the recurring sense of loss and reflection are hallmarks of the ghazal.",Legacy,0.87,False
Sonnet VIII,"Mondego! thou, whose waters cold and clear 
Gird those green banks, where fancy fain would stay, 
Fondly to muse on that departed day 
When Hope was kind and Friendship seem’d sincere;

To other shores, where other fountains stray,
And other rivers roll their proud career,

Shall lightly speed upon the plumes of thought, 
To bathe amongst thy waters cold and clear!

The poem also exhibits the characteristic blend of personal emotion with a broader contemplative tone, and the refrain-like quality in the address to Mondego, reminiscent of ghazal's invocation of a beloved or natural element.",Memory,0.92,False
Unstable Dream,"Unstable dream, according to the place,

The poem's exploration of longing, loss, and yearning for stability aligns with the emotional and structural elements typical of the ghazal form, even though the provided text is incomplete to fully confirm the ghazal's traditional paur (couplet) structure or the presence of a maqta (couplet's ending line that serves as the refrain). The recurring themes of desire and disappointment are also common in ghazals.",Longing,0.85,False
Sonnet XCI [I can in groups these mimic flowers compose],"Reflections on Some Drawings of Plants

I can in groups these mimic flowers compose,
  These bells and golden eyes, embathed in dew; 
Catch the soft blush that warms the early Rose, 
  Or the pale Iris cloud with veins of blue; 
Copy the scallop’d leaves, and downy stems, 
  And bid the pencil’s varied shades arrest 
Spring’s humid buds, and Summer’s musky gems: 
  But, save the portrait on my bleeding breast, 
I have no semblance of that form adored, 
  That form, expressive of a soul divine, 
  So early blighted, and while life is mine, 
With fond regret, and ceaseless grief deplored— 
  That grief, my angel! with too faithful art 
  Enshrines thy image in thy Mother’s heart. ",Charlotte Smith,sonnet,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it is composed of couplets (pairs of rhymed lines) that explore a central theme of longing and remembrance, typical of the ghazal's structure. Although the poem is not explicitly divided into clear stanzas or a clear ""qafi’"" (concluding couplet), the recurring themes of loss, art as a medium for memory, and the speaker's emotional state align with the common motifs in ghazals. The use of emotional introspection, occasional assonance rhyme (not strict end-rhyme in every line), and the personal, confessional tone also support the ghazal form, despite some variations from the strict classical definition.",Memory,,False
Chaucer,"Gone are the sensuous stars, and manifold,

Ten thousand swords of azure and of gold

An old man writing in a book of dreams,
And telling tales of lovers for the years;
Still Troilus hears a voice that whispers, Stay;

Let’s hear these motley pilgrims wile away
The tedious hours with stories of old things;
Or might some shining eagle claim
These lowly numbers for the House of Fame!",Benjamin Brawley,sonnet,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it features a recurring rhyme scheme (as commonly found in ghazals), addresses a theme of storytelling and recollection (often present in ghazals), and includes a closing couplet that suggests a refrain or a universal appeal, a hallmark of the ghazal's structure. Although the poem's meter and line breaks do not perfectly align with the strict classical ghazal (which typically uses a pakhawaj meter and a consistent quatrains/rhyme pattern), the presence of a narrative voice, the invocation of memory and tales from the past, and the poetic address to the listener are all evocative of the ghazal form. The poem’s lack of a clear, repeating refrain and the somewhat irregular stanza structure reduce certainty, but the thematic and structural cues align more closely with ghazal than the other forms listed.",Recitation,0.85,False
A Fixed Idea,"What torture lurks within a single thought

However welcome still, the weary mind
Aches with its presence. Dull remembrance taught

That all recurring joy is pain refined,
Become a habit, and we struggle, caught.

Folded in peace, for you can never know
How crushed I am with having you at rest
Heavy upon my life. I love you so
You bind my freedom from its rightful quest.

While the provided poem does not clearly display the traditional qafi’ or couplet structure typical in English ghazals (and some elements like the refrain or explicit metrical pattern are less pronounced), the meditation on emotional pain, the beloved, and the tension between presence and longing align with the typical subject matter and mood of the ghazal form. The poem’s reflective, yearning tone and focus on the ache of presence and absence are also common in ghazals.",Longing,0.85,False
Yourself,"’Tis to yourself I speak; you cannot know

Above the room wherein thou liest abed;
A word perhaps loud spoken thou mayst get,
Or hear our feet when heavily they tread;
But he who speaks, or him who’s spoken to,

Ghazals commonly explore themes of love and existential separation, often with a distinct rhyming pattern and a refrain-like quality in their opening lines, though this poem's form is more clearly defined by its quatrains and repeating thematic motifs rather than a traditional refrained opening. However, the emotional focus on distance and unbridgeable separation, the use of indirect address, and the lyrical, reflective tone align well with the conventions of the ghazal, even if the strict technicalities (like a pachghaz or mantiq) are not fully explicit in the given excerpt.",Separation,0.85,False

Ghazals are known for their thematic couplets, often with a refrain, and this poem’s introspective turn and repeated emphasis on self-examination align with the conventions of the form. The absence of a strict metrical pattern (like iambic pentameter) and the focus on love for self (with moral reflection) also fit the typical ghazal style.",Refrain,0.87,False
Modern Love: XXXVI,"My Lady unto Madam makes her bow.
The charm of women is, that even while

Discriminating compliments they raise,
That hit with wondrous aim on the weak point:
My Lady’s nose of Nature might complain.
It is not fashioned aptly to express
Her character of large-browed steadfastness.

The poem also explores the idea of creation, nature, and the interplay between masculine and feminine qualities, which is common in ghazals that meditate on idealized love and the divine or natural order.

Mary's Girlhood (for a Picture),"This is that blessed Mary, pre-elect

While the form presented here is slightly condensed and not strictly adhering to all historical conventions of the ghazal (such as the explicit use of a qafi' and a maqta' as a closing couplet), the structure of alternating couplets and the mystical, soul-searching tone strongly suggest a ghazal influence.",Lament,0.87,False

All alone at midnight, where did that beloved go?

Since he’s not here, to what “there” did he go?

If his heart and soul are joined with God,
And he left this realm of earth and water, where did he go?

Like ominous menhirs, close into their ring about the dark times.

Find a sensual frisson in what they’d call bling about the dark times.

Some of the young can project themselves into a Marshall Plan future
Where they laugh and link arms, reminiscing about the dark times.

From every spot-lit glitz tower with armed guards around it
Some huckster pronounces his fiats, self-sacralized king, about the dark times.

In a tent, in a queue, near barbed wire, in a shipping container,
Please remember ya akhy, we too know something about the dark times.

Only later discovering the Nation is divisible
by money by power by color by gender by sex America

The poem also explores themes of national identity, duality, and memory, which are common in ghazals that often reflect on love, loss, or national and personal identity. The structure hints at multiple voices or memories addressing a central motif (America), which aligns with the ghazal’s tradition of multiple couplets (padas) around a central theme or form.

But now, as though miraculously, it seems, here you are

not all that far beneath the skin, and even in

with all that isn't actually you having flowed 
through and settled in you, and made you what you are? 

The pain was never replaced, nor was it quite erased. 
It's memory now—so you know just how lucky you are. 

You didn't always. Were you then? And where's the fear?

Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
     He did a lazy sway . . .

To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.

Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.

Coming from a black man’s soul.

       Ain’t got nobody but ma self.
       I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’
       And put ma troubles on the shelf.""

All the Time Blues Villanelle,"Hard to watch somebody lose their mind
Maybe everybody    should just go get stoned
My father said it happens all the time

I knew a woman    lost her to soul to wine
But who doesn’t live with their life on loan?
Shame to watch somebody lose their mind

Don’tchu gotta wonder when people say they’re fine?
Given what we’re given, I guess they actin grown
I think I used to say that      all the time

When my parents died, I coined a little shrine
And thought about all the stuff they used to own
Felt like I was gonna lose my mind

Used to have a friend    who smiled all the time
Then he started sayin he could hear the devil moan
Hate to see a brotha lose his gotdam mind

Doesn’t matter how you pull, the hours break the line
Mirror, Mirror on the wall, how come nobody’s home?
Broke my soul for real, when my mother lost her mind

Tried to keep my head right, but sanity’s a climb
Been workin on the straight face—I guess my cover’s blown
My father tried to tell me     all the time

Had one last question, baby, but maybe never mind
After’while, even springtime starts to drone

Hard to see somebody lose their mind

"Go Down, Death","(A Funeral Sermon)

Weep not, weep not,
She is not dead;
She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.
Heart-broken husband—weep no more;
Grief-stricken son—weep no more;
Left-lonesome daughter—weep no more;
She only just gone home.

Day before yesterday morning,
God was looking down from his great, high heaven,
Looking down on all his children,
And his eye fell on Sister Caroline,
Tossing on her bed of pain.
And God’s big heart was touched with pity,
With the everlasting pity.

And God sat back on his throne,
And he commanded that tall, bright angel standing at his right hand:
Call me Death!
And that tall, bright angel cried in a voice
That broke like a clap of thunder:
Call Death!—Call Death!
And the echo sounded down the streets of heaven
Till it reached away back to that shadowy place,
Where Death waits with his pale, white horses.

And Death heard the summons,
And he leaped on his fastest horse,
Pale as a sheet in the moonlight.
Up the golden street Death galloped,
And the hooves of his horses struck fire from the gold,
But they didn’t make no sound.
Up Death rode to the Great White Throne,
And waited for God’s command.

And God said: Go down, Death, go down,
Go down to Savannah, Georgia,
Down in Yamacraw,
And find Sister Caroline.
She’s borne the burden and heat of the day,
She’s labored long in my vineyard,
And she’s tired—
She’s weary—
Go down, Death, and bring her to me.

And Death didn’t say a word,
But he loosed the reins on his pale, white horse,
And he clamped the spurs to his bloodless sides,
And out and down he rode,
Through heaven’s pearly gates,
Past suns and moons and stars;
on Death rode,
Leaving the lightning’s flash behind;
Straight down he came.

While we were watching round her bed,
She turned her eyes and looked away,
She saw what we couldn’t see;
She saw Old Death. She saw Old Death
Coming like a falling star.
But Death didn't frighten Sister Caroline;
He looked to her like a welcome friend.
And she whispered to us: I’m going home,
And she smiled and closed her eyes.

And Death took her up like a baby,
And she lay in his icy arms,
But she didn’t feel no chill.
And death began to ride again—
Up beyond the evening star,
Into the glittering light of glory,
On to the Great White Throne.
And there he laid Sister Caroline
On the loving breast of Jesus.

And Jesus took his own hand and wiped away her tears,
And he smoothed the furrows from her face,
And the angels sang a little song,
And Jesus rocked her in his arms,
And kept a-saying: Take your rest,
Take your rest.

Weep not—weep not,
She is not dead;
She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.",James Weldon Johnson,blues poem,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it is composed of couplets or tercets that do not rhyme consistently within the stanzas (a hallmark of ghazals), yet it features a recurring refrain (“Weep not—weep not,” and “She is not dead”) and an invocation of the divine, both common in ghazal structure. The poem also employs an address to the divine and personification of Death, typical of ghazal themes exploring mortality and the afterlife. The emotional tone and the layered, meditative movement through grief and hope are also consistent with the form’s tradition of exploring love, loss, and the divine.",Address,0.88,False
I’m a Fool to Love You,"Some folks will tell you the blues is a woman,
Some type of supernatural creature.
My mother would tell you, if she could,
About her life with my father,
A strange and sometimes cruel gentleman.
She would tell you about the choices
A young black woman faces.
Is falling in with some man
A deal with the devil
In blue terms, the tongue we use
When we don’t want nuance
To get in the way,
When we need to talk straight?
My mother chooses my father
After choosing a man
Who was, as we sing it,
Of no account.
This man made my father look good,
That’s how bad it was.
He made my father seem like an island
In the middle of a stormy sea,
He made my father look like a rock.
And is the blues the moment you realize
You exist in a stacked deck,
You look in a mirror at your young face,
The face my sister carries,
And you know it’s the only leverage
You’ve got?
Does this create a hurt that whispers
How you going to do?
Is the blues the moment
You shrug your shoulders 
And agree, a girl without money
Is nothing, dust 
To be pushed around by any old breeze? 
Compared to this,
My father seems, briefly,
To be a fire escape.
This is the way the blues works
Its sorry wonders,
Makes trouble look like
A feather bed,
Makes the wrong man’s kisses
A healing.
",Cornelius Eady,blues poem,Blues Poem,"This poem is a blues poem because it directly addresses the emotional experience and cultural context of the blues tradition. It uses personal, often painful narratives involving loss, struggle, and the resilience of the human spirit, common themes in classic blues poetry. The use of colloquial language, direct address, and rhetorical questions (""Does this create a hurt that whispers...?"") echo the oral and expressive nature of the blues genre. Additionally, the poem's focus on suffering, survival, and the transformation of pain into strength is a hallmark of blues poetry rather than the structured forms of a sonnet or ghazal. The absence of strict rhyme or meter, and the conversational, confessional tone, further support this classification.",Struggle,0.88,False
