[Weaned from life and flown away],"Weaned from life and flown away
In the morning of thy day, 
Bound in everlasting gloom, 
Buried in a hapless tomb.

Yet upon thy bended knee 
Thank the power that banished thee; 
Chain and bar and dungeon wall 
Saved thee from a deadlier thrall.

Thank the power that made thee part 
Ere that parting broke thy heart. 
Wildly rushed the mountain spring 
From its source of fern and ling; 
How invincible its roar, 
Had its waters worn the shore.",Emily Brontë,sonnet,Sonnet,"This poem is a sonnet because it contains 14 lines, which is the defining characteristic of a sonnet. The poem follows a consistent rhyme scheme with couplets (day/day, gloom/tomb, thee/thee, wall/thrall, etc.) and maintains a regular meter throughout. The structure presents a coherent argument or meditation on death and salvation, with the first eight lines establishing the situation of someone who has died young, and the final six lines offering a philosophical reflection on how this early death may have been a mercy. This volta or turn in thought is characteristic of sonnet form, even though the rhyme scheme is not the traditional Shakespearean or Petrarchan pattern.",Length,0.85
Of Love: A Sonnet,"How love came in I do not know,
Whether by the eye, or ear, or no;
Or whether with the soul it came
(At first) infused with the same;
Whether in part ’tis here or there,
Or, like the soul, whole everywhere,
This troubles me: but I as well
As any other this can tell:
That when from hence she does depart
The outlet then is from the heart.",Robert Herrick,sonnet,Sonnet,"This poem is a sonnet because it contains exactly 10 lines written in iambic tetrameter with a consistent AABBCCDDEE rhyme scheme. While it doesn't follow the traditional 14-line structure of Shakespearean or Petrarchan sonnets, it represents a shorter sonnet form that maintains the essential characteristics of unified thematic development, structured argumentation (the speaker contemplates how love enters and exits), and a concluding couplet that provides resolution. The poem's tight formal structure, consistent meter, and philosophical meditation on a single theme align with sonnet conventions, even in this compressed format.",Structure,0.85

For thee the labour of my studious ease

That you were once unkind befriends me now (Sonnet 120),"That you were once unkind befriends me now,

And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffer’d in your crime.
O, that our night of woe might have remember’d
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
And soon to you, as you to me, then tender’d

Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?,"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

On the Extinction of the Venetian Republic,"Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee;
And was the safeguard of the west: the worth
Of Venice did not fall below her birth,
Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.
She was a maiden City, bright and free;
No guile seduced, no force could violate;
And, when she took unto herself a Mate,
She must espouse the everlasting Sea.
And what if she had seen those glories fade,
Those titles vanish, and that strength decay;
Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
When her long life hath reached its final day:
Men are we, and must grieve when even the Shade
Of that which once was great is passed away.",William Wordsworth,sonnet,Sonnet,"This poem is a sonnet because it follows the classic 14-line structure with a clear rhyme scheme.

Sonnet VIII,"Mondego! thou, whose waters cold and clear 
Gird those green banks, where fancy fain would stay, 
Fondly to muse on that departed day 
When Hope was kind and Friendship seem’d sincere; 
—Ere I had purchas’d knowledge with a tear.
—Mondego! though I bend my pilgrim way 
To other shores, where other fountains stray,
And other rivers roll their proud career, 
Still—nor shall time, nor grief, nor stars severe, 
Nor widening distance e’er prevail in aught

And Memory oft, by old Affection taught, 
Shall lightly speed upon the plumes of thought, 
To bathe amongst thy waters cold and clear!

Sonnet XCI [I can in groups these mimic flowers compose],"Reflections on Some Drawings of Plants

Copy the scallop’d leaves, and downy stems, 
  And bid the pencil’s varied shades arrest 
Spring’s humid buds, and Summer’s musky gems: 
  But, save the portrait on my bleeding breast, 
I have no semblance of that form adored, 
  That form, expressive of a soul divine, 
  So early blighted, and while life is mine, 
With fond regret, and ceaseless grief deplored—

  Enshrines thy image in thy Mother’s heart.

Mary's Girlhood (for a Picture),"This is that blessed Mary, pre-elect

Strong in grave peace; in pity circumspect.

Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone:
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Who leaves unsway’d the likeness of a man,
Thy proud heart’s slave and vassal wretch to be:
    Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
    That she that makes me sin awards me pain.",William Shakespeare,sonnet,Sonnet,"This poem is a sonnet because it follows the classical Shakespearean sonnet structure with 14 lines written in iambic pentameter. The rhyme scheme follows the traditional ABAB CDCD EFEF GG pattern, with the final two lines forming a rhyming couplet that provides a concluding thought or ""turn."" The poem explores the theme of love despite physical imperfections, which is typical of Renaissance sonnets. The volta (turn) occurs in the final couplet where the speaker paradoxically finds gain in his pain, a characteristic feature of the sonnet form's argument structure.",Structure,1.0
Bereavement,"Whose was that gentle voice, that, whispering sweet, 
      Promised methought long days of bliss sincere! 
      Soothing it stole on my deluded ear, 
Most like soft music, that might sometimes cheat 
Thoughts dark and drooping! ’Twas the voice of Hope. 
      Of love and social scenes, it seemed to speak, 
      Of truth, of friendship, of affection meek; 
That, oh! poor friend, might to life’s downward slope 
Lead us in peace, and bless our latest hours. 
      Ah me! the prospect saddened as she sung; 
      Loud on my startled ear the death-bell rung; 
Chill darkness wrapt the pleasurable bowers, 
Whilst Horror, pointing to yon breathless clay, 
“No peace be thine,” exclaimed, “away, away!”",William Lisle Bowles,sonnet,Sonnet,"This poem is a sonnet because it contains exactly 14 lines, follows a clear rhyme scheme (ABBA CDCD EFEF GG), and explores a single thematic progression from hope to despair. The poem is written in iambic pentameter and follows the structural pattern of a Petrarchan sonnet with an octave (first 8 lines) presenting the initial situation of hope and gentle promises, followed by a sestet (final 6 lines) that provides the turn or ""volta"" where the tone shifts dramatically to one of horror and rejection. The rhyme scheme and meter are consistent with traditional sonnet form, and the philosophical meditation on hope versus reality is typical of sonnet subject matter.",Structure,0.95
Misgivings,"When ocean-clouds over inland hills
   Sweep storming in late autumn brown,
 And horror the sodden valley fills,
   And the spire falls crashing in the town,
 I muse upon my country’s ills—
 The tempest bursting from the waste of Time
On the world’s fairest hope linked with man’s foulest crime.

 Nature’s dark side is heeded now—
   (Ah! optimist-cheer disheartened flown)—
 A child may read the moody brow
   Of yon black mountain lone.
 With shouts the torrents down the gorges go,
 And storms are formed behind the storm we feel:
The hemlock shakes in the rafter, the oak in the driving keel.",Herman Melville,sonnet,Sonnet,"This poem is a sonnet because it contains 14 lines total, which is the defining structural characteristic of a sonnet. The poem is organized into two stanzas of 7 lines each (making it likely a variant sonnet form), and it follows a contemplative, meditative tone typical of sonnets that moves from observation of nature to deeper philosophical reflection. The poem begins with concrete imagery of storms and natural disaster, then transitions to broader musings about the country's condition and humanity's relationship with nature's darker aspects. This progression from specific to universal, along with the 14-line count, strongly indicates sonnet form rather than the other options, which have distinctly different structural requirements.",Structure,0.85
Despotisms,"I: THE MOTOR: 1905

From hedgerows where aromas fain would be

Into the ditch from bawling ruin flee:
Spindrift of one abominated sea
    Along all roads in wrecking fury flies
    Till on young strangled leaf, on bloom that dies,
In this far plot it writes a rune for me.

Vast intimate tyranny! Nature dispossessed

False God of pastime thou, vampire of rest,

The poem consists of an octave (first 8 lines) that presents the problem or observation about the motor's destructive impact on nature, followed by a sestet (final 6 lines) that develops the theme further and concludes with rhetorical questions. The rhyme scheme appears to be ABBA ABBA CDECDE, which is characteristic of a Petrarchan sonnet. The volta (turn) occurs between the octave and sestet, shifting from describing the motor's immediate environmental damage to addressing it directly as a ""False God"" and questioning its broader implications. The formal structure, line count, rhyme pattern, and thematic development all align with sonnet conventions.",Structure,0.95

The poem follows the Petrarchan (Italian) sonnet structure with an ABAB ABAB pattern in the first eight lines (octave), followed by a CDCD CC pattern in the final six lines (sestet). The content also follows the traditional sonnet convention of presenting a problem or meditation in the octave (the speaker's sleeplessness and inner turmoil caused by love) and then developing or resolving it in the sestet (explaining the contradictory nature of his sweet thoughts and painful desires). The language and imagery are characteristic of Renaissance love sonnets, focusing on the speaker's emotional state in contrast to the peaceful natural world around him.",Structure,0.95

The rhyme scheme appears to follow the pattern ABAB CDCD EEFFGG, and the volta (turn) occurs around line 9 with ""Thee an invisible auditor I fear,"" shifting from self-doubt to direct appeal.

“Where did the handsome beloved go?”,"Where did the handsome beloved go?
I wonder, where did that tall, shapely cypress tree go?

He spread his light among us like a candle.
Where did he go? So strange, where did he go without me?

All day long my heart trembles like a leaf.
All alone at midnight, where did that beloved go?

Go to the road, and ask any passing traveler — 
That soul-stirring companion, where did he go?

Go to the garden, and ask the gardener — 
That tall, shapely rose stem, where did he go?

Go to the rooftop, and ask the watchman — 
That unique sultan, where did he go?

Like a madman, I search in the meadows!
That deer in the meadows, where did he go?

My tearful eyes overflow like a river — 
That pearl in the vast sea, where did he go?

All night long, I implore both moon and Venus — 
That lovely face, like a moon, where did he go?

If he is mine, why is he with others?
Since he’s not here, to what “there” did he go?

If his heart and soul are joined with God,
And he left this realm of earth and water, where did he go?

Tell me clearly, Shams of Tabriz,
Of whom it is said, “The sun never dies” — where did he go?
 
 Translated from the Persian",Jalal al-Din Rumi,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the classic structural conventions of this Persian poetic form. Each couplet (called a ""sher"") is a complete thought that ends with the same refrain ""where did he go?"" (the radif), preceded by rhyming words that create the qafia. The poem consists of multiple independent couplets that can stand alone while contributing to the overall theme of longing for a departed beloved. The final couplet contains ""Shams of Tabriz,"" which appears to be the poet's signature (takhallus), another hallmark of the ghazal form. The repetitive questioning structure, the mystical/romantic theme of searching for the beloved, and the Persian origin all confirm this is a traditional ghazal.",Refrain,0.98

The poem consists of independent couplets that each express a complete thought while contributing to the overall theme of unrequited love and anguish. Most importantly, it ends with a ""makhta"" (signature couplet) where the poet directly addresses himself by name: ""You are mystical, Ghalib, and, also, you speak beautifully."" This self-referential ending couplet is a defining characteristic of the ghazal form.

The poem consists of multiple autonomous couplets that each explore different aspects of the speaker's experience as an immigrant, yet they're unified by this recurring end-word. The final couplet includes what appears to be the poet's name ""Dujie,"" which corresponds to the traditional maqta (signature couplet) where the poet includes their name.

your sarcenet line, my fingers knew taste before the orange

Dared on Norwood apartments, Dutch colonies
hunted man straight into your family crests of orange

Scraped from dust to crown our bruises, warriors we

As if we always knew we were history. Amber hardened into gold
tricking mortals, mortals tricking gods asking Was it the fruit or the color?

First, Tibbets’ grove, millions of fruits grafted
instead of born, from two parent orange trees

The key to a philosopher’s stone: Colormen flirting
with volcanos to retrieve your arsenic orpiment

Forever in danger of sliding into another color, I ran
after you, tracing rivers and creeks and streams of citrus

The poem consists of multiple couplets that are thematically linked but can stand independently, each exploring different aspects of the color/fruit orange. The repetitive ending creates the characteristic obsessive quality of a ghazal, where the poet returns again and again to the central image or concept.

the Son, and the Holy Spirit—Forgive me,
for I have sinned, become my own father—

havoc through absence, posture a myth for
any gaze. How many don’t know their father?

before bed. They will know their father

Each couplet ends with the same word ""father"" (the radif), and there's a consistent rhyme scheme leading up to this repeated word. The poem consists of independent couplets that each explore different aspects of the central theme while maintaining thematic unity. The final couplet appears to include the poet's voice more directly, which is characteristic of the ghazal form where poets often insert themselves into the concluding verses.

The couplets are thematically linked but operate as independent units, each exploring different aspects of the relationship between the speaker and the sea. The poem has the characteristic episodic quality of ghazals, moving from homeopathic healing, to fabric metaphors, to intimacy, to physical ailments, to environmental concerns, to mythology, to aging, and finally to philosophical reflection.

no swan has come, not a single one, to die.

The poem maintains thematic unity while each couplet can stand as an independent thought, which is characteristic of ghazals. The final couplet appears to reference the poet/speaker directly with ""one more swan,"" suggesting the traditional ghazal convention where the poet often references themselves in the final couplet.

Ghazal of Oranges,"On New Year’s Eve, my father overfills the baskets with oranges,

She lays her penance on her sister’s doorstep: a case of expensive oranges.

At the Whitney, I take a photo of a poem in a book behind the glass.

Each couplet (sher) is a complete thought or image that stands independently, yet all are unified by the repeated end-word ""oranges"" that appears at the end of each couplet's second line. This repetition of the radif (repeated word) is a defining characteristic of ghazals. The poem also demonstrates the typical ghazal quality of thematic unity through varied imagery - from New Year's traditions to art galleries to restaurants - all connected by the central motif of oranges. The final couplet contains what appears to be a reference to the poet's name ""Jan,"" which mirrors the traditional maqta (signature couplet) found in classical ghazals.

The poem consists of five couplets, each exploring different themes - therapy and drinking, family trauma and crime, maternal lies and power, childhood memories, and philosophical reflections on fire and divinity - yet all are bound together by the recurring ""night"" refrain.

The poem consists of seven couplets, which falls within the typical range of 5-15 couplets for a ghazal. Each couplet presents a complete thought or image while contributing to the overall thematic unity. The final couplet appears to contain a signature or reference to the poet with the Arabic phrase, which is reminiscent of the traditional maqta (signature couplet) found in classical ghazals.

The word immediately before ""daring"" in each couplet changes (""their,"" ""their,"" ""their,"" ""daring,"" ""future,"" ""daring,"" ""their,"" ""daring""), which demonstrates the qafia (rhyme scheme). The final couplet contains what appears to be the poet's name or signature (""Claudia""), which is characteristic of the maqta (signature couplet) in traditional ghazals.

Oceans of bone, an engine whose teeth shred all that is not our name.

When we find ourselves alone with all we’ve ever sought: our name?

Or perhaps what we seek lives outside of speech, like a tribe of goats
On a mountain above a lake, whose hooves nick away at rock. Our name

Is blown from tree to tree, scattered by the breeze. Who am I to say what,
In that marriage, is lost? For all I know, the grass has caught our name.

Having risen from moan to growl, growl to a hound’s low bray,
The voices catch. No priest, no sinner has yet been taught our name.

Our feet? Our name our name our name our fraught, fraught name.",Tracy K. Smith,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the traditional structure of this Persian poetic form. The poem consists of multiple couplets (seven in total) where each couplet ends with the same repeated phrase ""our name,"" which serves as the radif (the repeated word or phrase that appears after the rhyme in each couplet). The poem also demonstrates the thematic unity typical of ghazals, exploring variations on the central concept of identity and naming throughout. Each couplet operates as a semi-independent unit while contributing to the overall meditation on the theme, and the repetitive structure creates the hypnotic, incantatory quality characteristic of ghazals. The final couplet intensifies the repetition with ""Our name our name our name our fraught, fraught name,"" which echoes the traditional emphasis placed on the concluding couplet in ghazal form.",Radif,0.95

No sacrament    no scripture        There were no reservoirs
save an ark beneath the steeple when the rains came

First the river wouldn’t fill             Then the valley’s hills
rose like the back of a camel when the rains came

The piano pursed its mouth of strings      The tenor kissed
his weathered hymnal when the rains came

There was no weathered landscape           there were neither
the hanging gardens nor Babel when the rains came

Each couplet (sher) ends with the same refrain ""when the rains came,"" which serves as the radif (repeated phrase). The poem consists of multiple independent couplets that can stand alone thematically while contributing to an overall mood and subject. The final couplet appears to contain a reference to the poet's name or identity (""My name in Hebrew means Beloved""), which is characteristic of the maqta (signature couplet) in traditional ghazals.

"Speak Now, Or Forever. Hold Your Peace.","Draped in thick silk the hue of hemorrhage and bone, you fondle
your butt stocks, muffled lust needles your cheeks. Your aim? To
make America great. Again,

your terse-lipped Lord has nudged you into the glare—numbed

mistake America straight, contend

your unloosed crave for the sugared heat of triggers. Besotted beneath
your crowns of unspent shells, you hard-rhyme vows and
quake, aware of that weight again,

the gawky, feral gush of fetish. Every uncocked groom and rigid
bride is greased and un-tongued, struck dumb by what’s at

outbreak, bewaring that gate again,

left unlatched so this bright foolish can flow through. This ilk

make Amiri berate again,

’bout to conjure Fannie Lou and her tree-trunk wrists. While you
snot-weep, caress mute carbines, wed your unfathomable
ache, America waits. ’Cause when

fall naked first, whose shuddering tongue will dare the barrel?
Take that dare. Consummate. And then,

whose blood will that be?",Patricia Smith,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the traditional structure of this Persian poetic form with several key characteristics: it consists of multiple couplets (here appearing as stanzas) that each end with the same refrain word ""again"" (and variations like ""men,"" ""amen,"" ""upends,"" ""when,"" ""then""), which serves as the radif. The poem also demonstrates the ghazal's thematic independence between couplets while maintaining an overall emotional unity, and it includes the characteristic repetitive end-word pattern that creates both musical rhythm and thematic resonance. The final couplet appears to function as the traditional maqta or signature verse, asking the climactic question that brings the poem to its conclusion.",Refrain,0.85
Cast-Iron Ghazal,"My mouth won’t ever forget her skill with a skillet,
my father’s mother, cooking
with her mother’s skillet.

Looking deep into its heavy antique mirror, I see
her wedding day: white dress
and this coal-dark skillet.

Heaven was bacon’s sizzle waking my ears and nose.
Or was it one of her chickens 
slow-frying in the skillet?

Her husband once took it hunting without asking:
she said she’d bust his skull 
with that upraised skillet.

Fire-born bell whose clapper was a plain dinner fork,
juicy fauna and flora notes
rang out from her skillet.

I see early widowhood, cooked-for children gone:
darkness lends its seasoning
to every cast-iron skillet.

She hid its teardrop handle inside her strong grip
when pouring red-eye gravy
from one lip of the skillet.

What went into the oven as batter we two mixed
came out as cornbread glory,
steaming amen in a skillet.

Black as her Bible, black as her once-maiden hair,
black as a panther howling
at midnight, this skillet.

I see her funeral day, the kitchen filled with food
not made by her, no flame
kissing the empty skillet.

I say McFee into its circle, hear her savory voice 
giving back the family name 
from her (now my) skillet.",Michael McFee,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the traditional structure of this Persian poetic form with remarkable precision. Each couplet (called a ""sher"" in ghazal terminology) ends with the same refrain word ""skillet,"" which serves as the radif. The word preceding ""skillet"" in each couplet creates a rhyme scheme (qafiya), with words like ""skillet,"" ""skillet,"" ""skillet"" maintaining the exact repetition that defines a ghazal. The poem consists of multiple independent couplets that each present a complete thought or image while contributing to the overall theme of memory and family heritage centered around the grandmother's cooking implement. The final couplet contains ""McFee,"" which appears to be the poet's signature (takhallus), another hallmark of the ghazal form.

Ghazal: The Dark Times,"Tell us that line again, the thing about the dark times…
“When the dark times come, we will sing about the dark times.”

They’ll always be wrong about peace when they’re wrong about justice…
Were you wrong, were you right, insisting about the dark times?

The traditional fears, the habitual tropes of exclusion
Like ominous menhirs, close into their ring about the dark times.

Naysayers in sequins or tweeds, libertine or ascetic
Find a sensual frisson in what they’d call bling about the dark times.

Some of the young can project themselves into a Marshall Plan future
Where they laugh and link arms, reminiscing about the dark times.

From every spot-lit glitz tower with armed guards around it
Some huckster pronounces his fiats, self-sacralized king, about the dark times.

In a tent, in a queue, near barbed wire, in a shipping container,
Please remember ya akhy, we too know something about the dark times.

Sindbad’s roc, or Ganymede’s eagle, some bird of rapacious ill omen
From bleak skies descends, and wraps an enveloping wing about the dark times.

You come home from your meeting, your clinic, make coffee and look in the mirror
And ask yourself once more what you did to bring about the dark times.",Marilyn Hacker,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the traditional structure of this Persian poetic form with remarkable precision.

I said One Nation Invisible until corrected
maybe I was right about America

when we learned how to behave in America

What to wear, how to smoke, how to despise our parents
who didn’t understand us or America

Only later learning the Banner and the Beautiful
live on opposite sides of the street in America

Only later discovering the Nation is divisible
by money by power by color by gender by sex America

We comprehend it now this land is two lands
one triumphant bully one still hopeful America

purple mountains and no homeless in America

WWE,"Here’s your auntie, in her best gold-threaded shalwaar
kameez, made small by this land of american men.

at night watches the bodies of these glistening men.

Big and muscular, neck full of veins, bulging in the pen.
Her eyes kajaled & wide, glued to sweaty american men.

She smiles as guilty as a bride without blood, her love
of this new country, cold snow & naked american men.

“Stop living in a soap opera” yells her husband, fresh
from work, demanding his dinner: american. Men

take & take & yet you idolize them still, watch
your auntie as she builds her silent altar to them—

her knees fold on the rundown mattress, a prayer to WWE
Her tasbeeh & TV: the only things she puts before her husband. 

She covers bruises & never lets us eat leftovers: a good wife.

They can’t touch anyone without teeth & spit
unless one strips the other of their human skin.

Even now, you don’t get it. But whenever it’s on you watch
them snarl like mad dogs in a cage—these american men.

Now that you’re older your auntie calls to say he hit

A duplex consists of couplets where the second line of each couplet becomes loosely echoed or transformed in the first line of the next couplet, creating a chain-like progression. While the repetition isn't exact word-for-word as in a strict duplex, we can see thematic and sonic connections flowing between couplets: the idea of something ending/breaking connects the river stopping and the glass shattering, the sense of loss carries from the broken glass to the missing element in the bird's cry, and the progression moves through memory and naming toward the final image of the psychiatrist.

'One more day' was the pearl she bought in silence.

At night she heard the blacksmith hammering chains,
at dawn the saw, the fretwork wrought in silence.

'The only wrong I've done is to live too long,'
my Beloved's eyes tell the court in silence.

She's as young as the month of Ordibehesht,
month of my birth, spring's mid-leap caught in silence.

My Beloved, under the shade of a palm,
was the girl, the mother I sought in silence.

Loneliness is innumerate. Days slip by,
suns rise that daylight moons distort in silence.

The bell on her wrist was silent, her fingers
ice cold as the julep she brought in silence.

dropped in a well, keep falling short in silence.",Mimi Khalvati,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the traditional structure of this Persian poetic form.

The poem consists of multiple independent couplets that can stand alone thematically while contributing to the overall emotional landscape.

The Ghazal of What Hurt,"Pain froze you, for years—and fear—leaving scars. 
But now, as though miraculously, it seems, here you are 

walking easily across the ground, and into town 
as though you were floating on air, which in part you are, 

or riding a wave of what feels like the world's good will—
though helped along by something foreign and older than you are 

and yet much younger too, inside you, and so palpable 
an X-ray, you're sure, would show it, within the body you are,
 
not all that far beneath the skin, and even in 
some bones. Making you wonder: Are you what you are—

with all that isn't actually you having flowed 
through and settled in you, and made you what you are? 

The pain was never replaced, nor was it quite erased. 
It's memory now—so you know just how lucky you are. 

You didn't always. Were you then? And where's the fear?
Inside your words, like an engine? The car you are?! 

Face it, friend, you most exist when you're driven 
away, or on—by forms and forces greater than you are. ",Peter Cole,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it follows the traditional structure of this Persian verse form.

ferred person.

The poem consists of seven couplets, each functioning as a complete thought while contributing to the overall theme. Most importantly, the final couplet contains ""McHugh,"" which serves as the maqta (signature couplet) where the poet names themselves, a required element of the ghazal form.

Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
     He did a lazy sway . . .
     He did a lazy sway . . .
To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.

Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.

       Ain’t got nobody but ma self.
       I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’

Blues Franchise,"Blues as art as theme as exhibition

Up on a midtown metropolis edifice

Billboard façade 50 feet tall thirty feet wide: BLUE SMOKE

Of a black femme-like face framed by her fingers tapered upward in the V of her palms

Looking off, her eyes below her painted on eyebrows

And Caucasoid wig solid black

touching off of a violet plunging deeper into the decorated pigment

A frame furls hints of blue in a spectral geometry

Framing tightly the face, reposed

A white strap over one deep ochre shoulder as background

 
Could be trans-shim or a delightful Caledonia,

red skein of a lipstick kiss imprinted invisibly in a nano dimension

 
Replications across the marquees of legions of subway cars

Her face on the mini billboard above the seat next to

The moving doors

Always looking somewhere else as the

Masses travel to all destinations

Blues smoke surrounding whatever stage as forum

For the franchise

Forever after for as far as the past goes.

 
Entering the negative space of a corporate behemoth

A lobby of the skyscraper museum or loft like enclosures

interlocking directorates of high art residencies.

The presence of your body

While it doesn't follow strict traditional rhyme schemes like Shakespearean (ABAB CDCD EFEF GG) or Petrarchan (ABBAABBA CDECDE) sonnets, it maintains the essential 14-line structure and thematic development pattern of the sonnet form.

The final couplet introduces the poet's voice more directly with ""My pop said,"" which is characteristic of the maqta (signature couplet) in ghazals.

"Go Down, Death","(A Funeral Sermon)

Weep not, weep not,
She is not dead;
She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.
Heart-broken husband—weep no more;
Grief-stricken son—weep no more;
Left-lonesome daughter—weep no more;
She only just gone home.

Day before yesterday morning,
God was looking down from his great, high heaven,
Looking down on all his children,
And his eye fell on Sister Caroline,
Tossing on her bed of pain.
And God’s big heart was touched with pity,
With the everlasting pity.

And God sat back on his throne,
And he commanded that tall, bright angel standing at his right hand:
Call me Death!
And that tall, bright angel cried in a voice
That broke like a clap of thunder:
Call Death!—Call Death!
And the echo sounded down the streets of heaven
Till it reached away back to that shadowy place,
Where Death waits with his pale, white horses.

And Death heard the summons,
And he leaped on his fastest horse,
Pale as a sheet in the moonlight.
Up the golden street Death galloped,
And the hooves of his horses struck fire from the gold,
But they didn’t make no sound.
Up Death rode to the Great White Throne,
And waited for God’s command.

And God said: Go down, Death, go down,
Go down to Savannah, Georgia,
Down in Yamacraw,
And find Sister Caroline.
She’s borne the burden and heat of the day,
She’s labored long in my vineyard,
And she’s tired—
She’s weary—
Go down, Death, and bring her to me.

And Death didn’t say a word,
But he loosed the reins on his pale, white horse,
And he clamped the spurs to his bloodless sides,
And out and down he rode,
Through heaven’s pearly gates,
Past suns and moons and stars;
on Death rode,
Leaving the lightning’s flash behind;
Straight down he came.

While we were watching round her bed,
She turned her eyes and looked away,
She saw what we couldn’t see;
She saw Old Death. She saw Old Death
Coming like a falling star.
But Death didn't frighten Sister Caroline;
He looked to her like a welcome friend.
And she whispered to us: I’m going home,
And she smiled and closed her eyes.

And Death took her up like a baby,
And she lay in his icy arms,
But she didn’t feel no chill.
And death began to ride again—
Up beyond the evening star,
Into the glittering light of glory,
On to the Great White Throne.
And there he laid Sister Caroline
On the loving breast of Jesus.

And Jesus took his own hand and wiped away her tears,
And he smoothed the furrows from her face,
And the angels sang a little song,
And Jesus rocked her in his arms,
And kept a-saying: Take your rest,
Take your rest.

I’m a Fool to Love You,"Some folks will tell you the blues is a woman,
Some type of supernatural creature.
My mother would tell you, if she could,
About her life with my father,
A strange and sometimes cruel gentleman.
She would tell you about the choices
A young black woman faces.
Is falling in with some man
A deal with the devil
In blue terms, the tongue we use
When we don’t want nuance
To get in the way,
When we need to talk straight?
My mother chooses my father
After choosing a man
Who was, as we sing it,
Of no account.
This man made my father look good,
That’s how bad it was.
He made my father seem like an island
In the middle of a stormy sea,
He made my father look like a rock.
And is the blues the moment you realize
You exist in a stacked deck,
You look in a mirror at your young face,
The face my sister carries,
And you know it’s the only leverage
You’ve got?
Does this create a hurt that whispers
How you going to do?
Is the blues the moment
You shrug your shoulders 
And agree, a girl without money
Is nothing, dust 
To be pushed around by any old breeze? 
Compared to this,
My father seems, briefly,
To be a fire escape.
This is the way the blues works
Its sorry wonders,
Makes trouble look like
A feather bed,
Makes the wrong man’s kisses

The content directly addresses ""the blues"" as a concept, exploring the emotional and social circumstances that give rise to blues music - particularly the experiences of African American women facing limited choices and difficult relationships. The poem uses blues vernacular (""blue terms,"" ""the tongue we use"") and poses rhetorical questions in a call-and-response style reminiscent of blues structure. The narrative follows the classic blues pattern of describing hardship, making difficult choices, and finding temporary solace in problematic solutions. The free verse form allows for the conversational, storytelling quality typical of blues poetry, while the repetitive questioning (""Is the blues..."") creates a musical, incantatory effect that mirrors blues repetition patterns.",Thematic,0.95
