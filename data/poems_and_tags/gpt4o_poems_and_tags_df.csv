[Weaned from life and flown away],"Weaned from life and flown away
In the morning of thy day, 
Bound in everlasting gloom, 
Buried in a hapless tomb.

Chain and bar and dungeon wall 
Saved thee from a deadlier thrall.

No guile seduced, no force could violate;
And, when she took unto herself a Mate,
She must espouse the everlasting Sea.

And Memory oft, by old Affection taught, 
Shall lightly speed upon the plumes of thought, 
To bathe amongst thy waters cold and clear!

Pho in the South End. Oxtail in Queens. Tinned fish. Cannoli in
Little Italy. No-contact delivery. The food of my country.

Fifty or so provincial patches of grass—upon closer look—leaves. 
The edge, where people live, frays in this country.

“We can work on human rights while negotiating,” the Senator 
says, “the prospects of nuclear war in our country.”

I was born in the Philippines, so my native tongue is partisanship.
I’m many parties. I’m made impartial by my country—

a professional, ministerial office holder. A biblical fortune.
It’s libidinal, the we in the ballad that makes a land.

It’s provisional, the line that cuts through sand. I is a line
with a place to stand. I is a framing device. What good is a nation. 

Parts of speech like mine fragment. Cut. Clean. I’m rightless 
but I have capital. Charge me, Dujie, precis a person. ",Dujie Tahat,ghazal,Duplex,"This poem aligns with the duplex form since it features a unique structure where the first line of each stanza is repeated as the last line of the following stanza. This creates a sense of continuity and reflection, which can be observed in the poem's exploration of identity, belonging, and the speaker's relationship with their ""country."" The rhythmic repetition enhances the emotive quality and ties the fragmented thoughts together.",Repetition,0.85
Even The Rain,"What will suffice for a true-love knot? Even the rain?

But he has bought grief’s lottery, bought even the rain.

“Our glosses / wanting in this world”—“Can you remember?”

Anyone!—“when we thought / the poets taught” even the rain?

After we died—That was it!—God left us in the dark.

And as we forgot the dark, we forgot even the rain.

Drought was over. Where was I? Drinks were on the house.

For mixers, my love, you’d poured—what?—even the rain.

Of this pear-shaped orange’s perfumed twist, I will say:

Extract Vermouth from the bergamot, even the rain.

How did the Enemy love you—with earth? air? and fire?

He held just one thing back till he got even: the rain.

This is God’s site for a new house of executions?

You swear by the Bible, Despot, even the rain?

After the bones—those flowers—this was found in the urn:

The lost river, ashes from the ghat, even the rain.

What was I to prophesy if not the end of the world?

A salt pillar for the lonely lot, even the rain.

How the air raged, desperate, streaming the earth with flames—

To help burn down my house, Fire sought even the rain.

He would raze the mountains, he would level the waves;

he would, to smooth his epic plot, even the rain.

New York belongs at daybreak to only me, just me—

To make this claim Memory’s brought even the rain.

They’ve found the knife that killed you, but whose prints are these?

No one has such small hands, Shahid, not even the rain.",Agha Shahid Ali,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it adheres to the key characteristics of the form: it consists of multiple couplets that can stand alone, and each couplet ends with the same refrain, ""even the rain,"" which creates emotional resonance throughout. Additionally, the lines convey themes of love, loss, and memory, which align with the often personal and enigmatic nature of ghazals. The use of thematic repetition and the slight shifts in context from couplet to couplet further reinforce its connection to this form.",Refrain,0.95
Orange,"If I have a gender, let it be a history learned from orange
Freak            Sun Sucker           Queer            Orange Boy

Rumor of 6th grade sunrise, dressed in you I was a child
of unspeakable obsession. Archaic language, Giolureade

Until Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scots. Her lips unlocked
your sarcenet line, my fingers knew taste before the orange

Dared on Norwood apartments, Dutch colonies
hunted man straight into your family crests of orange

Scraped from dust to crown our bruises, warriors we
stared directly into the sun, Tainos dyed in orange

As if we always knew we were history. Amber hardened into gold
tricking mortals, mortals tricking gods asking Was it the fruit or the color?

First, Tibbets’ grove, millions of fruits grafted
instead of born, from two parent orange trees

The key to a philosopher’s stone: Colormen flirting
with volcanos to retrieve your arsenic orpiment

Forever in danger of sliding into another color, I ran
after you, tracing rivers and creeks and streams of citrus

The Washington Navel Orange, a second fruit protruding:
not a twin, nor translation, but a new name every season.",Noel Quiñones,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it consists of multiple couplets that follow a theme of longing, identity, and transformation through the repeated motif of the color orange and its associations. Each couplet reads like a standalone poem while contributing to a larger narrative, which is characteristic of the ghazal form. The presence of a refrain ('orange') at the end of several lines also aligns with the traditional structure of a ghazal, where a repeated word or phrase appears in the second line of each couplet. The emotional resonance and exploration of personal and historical identity further enhance its fit as a ghazal.",Refrain,0.85
Ghazal Circling Fatherhood,"My mother exalts her long-gone father.
Driving home, laments the failings of my father.

Sees her ex-husband in my excuses,
tells me: That’s just like your father. 

On holiday, he sneaks away to work;
I take a work call. Like son, like father.

Before, I tried to outrun my shadow
when sun met twilight, like Earth’s late father.

God sacrificed his son for his life’s work.
So we sing heavenward to honor the Father,

the Son, and the Holy Spirit—Forgive me,
for I have sinned, become my own father—

not who raised me, but those who claim me
as theirs. The stone-jawed men who father

havoc through absence, posture a myth for
any gaze. How many don’t know their father?

I’m at my kids’ school, bath time, rubbing their backs
before bed. They will know their father

as the one who showed up & always stayed,
bleary-eyed, did anything to father.

My mother fears she will be forgotten,
invoking Time, like others, as a father.

My wife notes the shifting sky above us.
What gravity gives birth to a father?",Carlos Andrés Gómez,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it is composed of couplets that are thematically linked, exploring the concept of fatherhood and familial relationships from different angles. Each couplet, or matla, stands alone, yet is connected by the recurring invocation of ""father"" as a central theme. The consistent architectural structure with the refrain and the exploration of personal and spiritual dimensions also align perfectly with the qualities of a ghazal. Additionally, the poem employs a rhyme scheme characteristic of this form, where the last words in the couplets echo the same theme while maintaining distinct and rich emotional imagery.",Refrain,0.92
Ghazal: Sea,"As Karen Blixen said, the cure’s the sea
—or sweat, or tears—but I prefer the sea.

In fact, it’s homeopathy. Why cry
with eyes baptised (if reddened) by the sea?

The metaphors of fabric come to mind:
cool silk or aqua velvet, summer sea

            (or better, come to body: intimate,
            enveloped skin on skin, the lover sea).

The bone-ache deep, the pains gone unexplained:
for now just dive, ameliorator sea.

The “mermaid’s tears,” smoothed glass or plastic: lovely
but hazardous to creatures of the sea.

This evening’s rough: Poseidon snaps my straps.
Pathetic fallacy, bipolar sea.

And in their one-piece suits, the ladies age
and silver, laugh and rage: September sea.

For whatever we lose(like a you or a me)
it’s always ourselves we find in the sea.",Moira Egan,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem aligns with the ghazal form due to its structure of couplets that contain autonomous ideas, while thematically revolving around a central motif—the sea. Each couplet stands alone, much like the couplets in a ghazal that often contain a refrain. The use of repeated phrases such as ""the sea"" at the end of many couplets creates a cohesive thread, reminiscent of the refrain style common in ghazals. Additionally, the emotional resonance and exploration of loss and connection are key thematic elements that reflect the evocative nature of traditional ghazals.",Refrain,0.85
Swan Song,"They say when the time comes for a swan to die,
it goes where other swans have gone to die.

They say as the last night begins to fall,
it trails behind the setting sun to die.

And it sings ghazals, as though it wished between
the pages of its own divan to die.

They say a swan loves only once and will
return to where its love was won to die.

Making its deathbed where it first made love,
it can forget it has withdrawn to die.

Are these tales true? In the desert, where I live,
no swan has come, not a single one, to die.

But then they say that swans return to water,
in whose embrace life was begun, to die.

Open your arms, my dear, and slake my thirst:
the time has come for one more swan to die.",Armen Davoudian,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it adheres to the defining features of this form, including the repetition of a phrase at the end of each couplet: ""to die."" Additionally, each couplet can stand independently while contributing to an overarching theme—here, the cyclical nature of love and death, as encapsulated by the imagery of swans. The structure of couplets, along with the contemplative and emotive language, aligns well with the traditional characteristics of a ghazal.",Repetition,0.95
Ghazal of Oranges,"On New Year’s Eve, my father overfills the baskets with oranges,
mangoes, grapes, grapefruits, other citrus too, but mostly oranges.

The morning of the first, he opens every window to let the new year in.
In Chinatown, red bags sag with mustard greens and mandarin oranges.

A farmer in a fallow season kneels to know the dirt. More silt than soil,
he wipes his brow and mumbles to his dog: time to give up this crop of oranges.

The woman knows she let herself say too much to someone undeserving.
She lays her penance on her sister’s doorstep: a case of expensive oranges.

At the Whitney, I take a photo of a poem in a book behind the glass.
Above it, a painting: smears of blue, Frank O’Hara, his messy oranges.

The handsome server speaks with his hands: Tonight is grilled octopus
with braised fennel and olives, topped with peppercress, cara caras, and blood oranges.

No one at the table looks up, ashamed by the prices on the chic menus.
The busser fills my water and I inhale him: his faraway scent of oranges.

Seventh grade, Southern California: we monitored the daily smog alerts.
Red: stay inside. White: play outside. I forget what warning orange is.

Clutch was serious about art and said our final projects could be
whatever . . . performative . . . like, just show up with a wheelbarrow full of oranges.

Jan, in all of those first six years, why is all you can remember this:
the mist rising in the sunny air as you watched her peeling oranges.",Jan-Henry Gray,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem exhibits characteristics of a ghazal due to its structure of couplets that are thematically linked through the recurring motif of ""oranges."" Each couplet introduces a new perspective or narrative while still adhering to the overarching theme, similar to how a ghazal operates with its distinct and often self-contained verses. Additionally, there is a notable refrain-like quality with the repetitive appearance of ""oranges,"" which serves as a pivot between the stanzas, enhancing the ghazal’s intimate and reflective tone.",Theme,0.85
What of Fire?,"My therapist has approved my drinking of three whiskeys per night,
her eyes forbearing, knowing well the ruthlessness of night.

The sun having fled as a father might flee, my cousin fathered
a narrow terror while he robbed, with a pistol, a fellow citizen one night.

The encouraging lies of a mother are greatly underpaid job-keepers;
slovenly kings have dealt much wrong money to generals and knights.

My childhood was a lengthy scene of make believe and disaccord—
my favorite things being rain and watching my mother’s cigarettes ignite.

What of fire, among its timelessness and musculature, is not
more divine when burning past the open gates of night?",Marcus Jackson,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it consists of multiple couplets, each of which can stand on its own while also connecting thematically through motifs of night, memory, and personal struggle. Additionally, the structure adheres to the ghazal's characteristic of ending couplets with the same refrain (in this case, thematic echoes of night and darkness), as well as the presence of rich imagery and emotional depth.",Structure,0.85
Ghazal !,"A lot more malaise and a little more grief every day,

aware that all seasons, the stormy, the sunlit, are brief every day. 

I don’t know the name of the hundredth drowned child, just the names

of the oligarchs trampling the green, eating beef every day,

while luminous creatures flick, stymied, above and around

the plastic detritus that’s piling up over the reef every day.

A tiny white cup of black coffee in afternoon shade,

while an oud or a sax plays brings breath and relief every day. 

Another beginning, no useful conclusion in sight‚—

another first draft that I tear out and add to the sheaf every day. 

One name, three-in-one, ninety-nine, or a matrix of tales 

that are one story only, well-springs of belief every day.

But I wake before dawn to read news that arrived overnight

on a minuscule screen , and exclaim  ?? ???? every day.",Marilyn Hacker,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem embodies the structure of a ghazal as it contains couplets that reflect on varied themes related to grief, loss, and the mundane repetitions of life, each ending in the refrain ""every day."" The lack of a narrative progression and the thematic consistency across the couplets are key characteristics. Furthermore, the presence of personal reflection alongside universal concerns aligns with traditional ghazal themes.",Refrain,0.85
Vindication,"They signed The Declaration of Sentiments

with nib of rib, the right to suffrage their daring

Called ugly then witch, pretty then weak

to be at once woman and voter, their daring

Hunger, headaches, heartaches, hatred, death

As men are born, with God’s grace, so are women

they urged and argued with brains and daring

With firm convictions and hopes of fallen yokes

steadfast they marched nursing dreams of future daring

There is more work on the horizon, more

yeast to knead into the bread of their daring

Persist Claudia! in mind and body be

not ugly, not pretty, but ablaze with daring.",Claudia Castro Luna,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem exhibits the characteristics of a ghazal, primarily through its use of couplets and the repetition of the word ""daring"" at the end of multiple verses. Each couplet stands alone, delving into different themes of female empowerment and suffrage while maintaining a cohesive emotional resonance. The refrain contributes to the lyrical quality typical in ghazals, emphasizing the depth of the struggles faced by women throughout history.",Refrain,0.85
Ghazal,"The sky is a dry pitiless white. The wide rows stretch on into death.
Like famished birds, my hands strip each stalk of its stolen crop: our name.
History is a ship forever setting sail. On either shore: mountains of men,
Oceans of bone, an engine whose teeth shred all that is not our name.

Can you imagine what will sound from us, what we’ll rend and claim
When we find ourselves alone with all we’ve ever sought: our name?

Or perhaps what we seek lives outside of speech, like a tribe of goats
On a mountain above a lake, whose hooves nick away at rock. Our name

Is blown from tree to tree, scattered by the breeze. Who am I to say what,
In that marriage, is lost? For all I know, the grass has caught our name.

Having risen from moan to growl, growl to a hound’s low bray,
The voices catch. No priest, no sinner has yet been taught our name.

Will it thunder up, the call of time? Or lie quiet as bedrock beneath
Our feet? Our name our name our name our fraught, fraught name.",Tracy K. Smith,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it adheres to the structural characteristics typical of the form: it features couplets, each standing alone in meaning while also being thematically connected. Additionally, the poem has a refrain (""our name"") that is repeated at the end of several couplets, which is a hallmark of the ghazal. The exploration of personal and collective identity, as well as the existential queries presented throughout, resonate with the emotional depth often found in ghazals.",Refrain,0.85
Reservoirs,"The apple was not an apple when the rains came
The grave spurned the groundskeeper’s shovel when the rains came

No sacrament    no scripture        There were no reservoirs
save an ark beneath the steeple when the rains came

First the river wouldn’t fill             Then the valley’s hills
rose like the back of a camel when the rains came

The piano pursed its mouth of strings      The tenor kissed
his weathered hymnal when the rains came

There was no weathered landscape           there were neither
the hanging gardens nor Babel when the rains came

Lying on his back            the shepherd fanned his arms and legs
No one told him he couldn’t impress an angel when the rains came

our glosses / wanting in this world    Can you remember?
My name in Hebrew means Beloved or      blissful when the rains came",David Welch,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it adheres to the structure typical of this form, comprising several couplets that are thematically connected yet can stand alone.

Cast-Iron Ghazal,"My mouth won’t ever forget her skill with a skillet,
my father’s mother, cooking
with her mother’s skillet.

Looking deep into its heavy antique mirror, I see
her wedding day: white dress
and this coal-dark skillet.

Heaven was bacon’s sizzle waking my ears and nose.
Or was it one of her chickens 
slow-frying in the skillet?

Her husband once took it hunting without asking:
she said she’d bust his skull 
with that upraised skillet.

Fire-born bell whose clapper was a plain dinner fork,
juicy fauna and flora notes
rang out from her skillet.

I see early widowhood, cooked-for children gone:
darkness lends its seasoning
to every cast-iron skillet.

She hid its teardrop handle inside her strong grip
when pouring red-eye gravy
from one lip of the skillet.

What went into the oven as batter we two mixed
came out as cornbread glory,
steaming amen in a skillet.

Black as her Bible, black as her once-maiden hair,
black as a panther howling
at midnight, this skillet.

I see her funeral day, the kitchen filled with food
not made by her, no flame
kissing the empty skillet.

I say McFee into its circle, hear her savory voice

from her (now my) skillet.",Michael McFee,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it consists of couplets, each able to stand alone while contributing to an overarching theme of memory and a familial connection to a specific object, the skillet.

The traditional fears, the habitual tropes of exclusion
Like ominous menhirs, close into their ring about the dark times.

Naysayers in sequins or tweeds, libertine or ascetic
Find a sensual frisson in what they’d call bling about the dark times.

Some of the young can project themselves into a Marshall Plan future
Where they laugh and link arms, reminiscing about the dark times.

From every spot-lit glitz tower with armed guards around it
Some huckster pronounces his fiats, self-sacralized king, about the dark times.

In a tent, in a queue, near barbed wire, in a shipping container,
Please remember ya akhy, we too know something about the dark times.

Sindbad’s roc, or Ganymede’s eagle, some bird of rapacious ill omen

Each couplet presents a variation on the central idea of America, concluding with a consistent refrain, ""America.""

WWE,"Here’s your auntie, in her best gold-threaded shalwaar

Her eyes kajaled & wide, glued to sweaty american men.

She smiles as guilty as a bride without blood, her love

her knees fold on the rundown mattress, a prayer to WWE

They can’t touch anyone without teeth & spit

as though you were floating on air, which in part you are, 

or riding a wave of what feels like the world's good will—
though helped along by something foreign and older than you are 

and yet much younger too, inside you, and so palpable 
an X-ray, you're sure, would show it, within the body you are,
 
not all that far beneath the skin, and even in 
some bones. Making you wonder: Are you what you are—

with all that isn't actually you having flowed 
through and settled in you, and made you what you are? 

The pain was never replaced, nor was it quite erased. 
It's memory now—so you know just how lucky you are. 

You didn't always. Were you then? And where's the fear?
Inside your words, like an engine? The car you are?! 

Face it, friend, you most exist when you're driven 
away, or on—by forms and forces greater than you are. ",Peter Cole,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem exhibits the characteristics of a ghazal through its thematic structure, couplet form, and the use of a refrain-like repetition of certain ideas (such as self-identity and the interplay between pain and existence). Each couplet presents a standalone idea while still connecting to the overarching theme of introspection and identity, which is typical of ghazals. Additionally, there is a consistent exploration of the duality of being shaped by external forces that enhance the emotional undertone characteristic of ghazals.",Duality,0.85
Ghazal of the Better-Unbegun,"Too volatile, am I?  too voluble?  too much a word-person?
I blame the soup:  I'm a primordially
stirred person.

Two pronouns and a vehicle was Icarus with wings.
The apparatus of his selves made an ab-
surd person.

The sound I make is sympathy's:  sad dogs are tied afar.
But howling I become an ever more un-
heard person.

I need a hundred more of you to make a likelihood.
The mirror's not convincing-- that at-best in-
ferred person.

As time's revealing gets revolting, I start looking out.
Look in and what you see is one unholy
blurred person.

The only cure for birth one doesn't love to contemplate.
Better to be an unsung song, an unoc-
curred person.

McHugh, you'll be the death of me -- each self and second studied!
Addressing you like this, I'm halfway to the
third person.",Heather McHugh,ghazal,Ghazal,"This poem is a ghazal because it consists of a series of couplets that stand independently, with each stanza reflecting on themes of identity and self-perception, which are common in ghazal poetry. The repeated use of the phrase ""person"" at the end of several lines echoes the traditional structure of a ghazal, where a refrain occurs at the end of the couplets. The emotional introspection and exploration of multiple selves also align with the thematic essence often found in ghazals.",Refrain,0.85

The Weary Blues,"Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
     I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
     He did a lazy sway . . .
     He did a lazy sway . . .
To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.
     O Blues!
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
     Sweet Blues!
Coming from a black man’s soul.
     O Blues!
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—
     ""Ain’t got nobody in all this world,
       Ain’t got nobody but ma self.
       I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’
       And put ma troubles on the shelf.""

Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords then he sang some more—

       And I can’t be satisfied.
       Got the Weary Blues
       And can’t be satisfied—
       I ain’t happy no mo’
       And I wish that I had died.""

Blues Franchise,"Blues as art as theme as exhibition

Up on a midtown metropolis edifice

Billboard façade 50 feet tall thirty feet wide: BLUE SMOKE

Of a black femme-like face framed by her fingers tapered upward in the V of her palms

Looking off, her eyes below her painted on eyebrows

And Caucasoid wig solid black

touching off of a violet plunging deeper into the decorated pigment

A frame furls hints of blue in a spectral geometry

Framing tightly the face, reposed

A white strap over one deep ochre shoulder as background

 
Could be trans-shim or a delightful Caledonia,

red skein of a lipstick kiss imprinted invisibly in a nano dimension

 
Replications across the marquees of legions of subway cars

Her face on the mini billboard above the seat next to

The moving doors

Always looking somewhere else as the

Masses travel to all destinations

Blues smoke surrounding whatever stage as forum

Forever after for as far as the past goes.

The presence of your body

with empty belly;
these are the American

shanties, and fine

song
on a poor man’s tongue
land of cotton and trouble
night sweet as dusk
on its gentle people

had to stop

was beautiful

from Memphis to Georgia
drinking my whiskey

singing my blues",Sam Cornish,blues poem,Blues poem,"This poem embodies the essence of a blues poem through its use of rhythmic language, themes of traveling, hunger, and the deep cultural roots of blues music.

Riverbank Blues,"A man git his feet set in a sticky mudbank,
A man git dis yellow water in his blood,
No need for hopin', no need for doin',
Muddy streams keep him fixed for good.

Little Muddy, Big Muddy, Moreau and Osage,
Little Mary's, Big Mary's, Cedar Creek,
Flood deir muddy water roundabout a man's roots,
Keep him soaked and stranded and git him weak.

Lazy sun shinin' on a little cabin,
Lazy moon glistenin' over river trees;
Ole river whisperin', lappin' 'gainst de long roots:
""Plenty of rest and peace in these . . .""

Big mules, black loam, apple and peach trees,
But seems lak de river washes us down
Past de rich farms, away from de fat lands,
Dumps us in some ornery riverbank town.

Went down to the river, sot me down an' listened,
Heard de water talkin' quiet, quiet lak an' slow:
""Ain' no need fo' hurry, take yo' time, take yo'
time . . ."" Heard it sayin'—""Baby, hyeahs de way life go . . .""

Dat is what it tole me as I watched it slowly rollin',
But somp'n way inside me rared up an' say,
""Better be movin' . . . better be travelin' . . .
Riverbank'll git you ef you stay . . .""

Towns are sinkin' deeper, deeper in de riverbank,
Takin' on de ways of deir sulky Ole Man—
Takin' on his creepy ways, takin' on his evil ways,
""Bes' git way, a long way . . . whiles you can. Man got his
sea too lak de Mississippi Ain't got so long for a whole lot longer way,
Man better move some, better not git rooted Muddy water fool you, ef you stay . . .""",Sterling A.

"Go Down, Death","(A Funeral Sermon)

Weep not, weep not,
She is not dead;
She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.
Heart-broken husband—weep no more;
Grief-stricken son—weep no more;
Left-lonesome daughter—weep no more;
She only just gone home.

Day before yesterday morning,
God was looking down from his great, high heaven,
Looking down on all his children,
And his eye fell on Sister Caroline,
Tossing on her bed of pain.
And God’s big heart was touched with pity,
With the everlasting pity.

And God sat back on his throne,
And he commanded that tall, bright angel standing at his right hand:
Call me Death!
And that tall, bright angel cried in a voice
That broke like a clap of thunder:
Call Death!—Call Death!
And the echo sounded down the streets of heaven
Till it reached away back to that shadowy place,
Where Death waits with his pale, white horses.

And Death heard the summons,
And he leaped on his fastest horse,
Pale as a sheet in the moonlight.
Up the golden street Death galloped,
And the hooves of his horses struck fire from the gold,
But they didn’t make no sound.
Up Death rode to the Great White Throne,
And waited for God’s command.

And God said: Go down, Death, go down,
Go down to Savannah, Georgia,
Down in Yamacraw,
And find Sister Caroline.
She’s borne the burden and heat of the day,
She’s labored long in my vineyard,
And she’s tired—
She’s weary—
Go down, Death, and bring her to me.

And Death didn’t say a word,
But he loosed the reins on his pale, white horse,
And he clamped the spurs to his bloodless sides,
And out and down he rode,
Through heaven’s pearly gates,
Past suns and moons and stars;
on Death rode,
Leaving the lightning’s flash behind;
Straight down he came.

While we were watching round her bed,
She turned her eyes and looked away,
She saw what we couldn’t see;
She saw Old Death. She saw Old Death
Coming like a falling star.
But Death didn't frighten Sister Caroline;
He looked to her like a welcome friend.
And she whispered to us: I’m going home,
And she smiled and closed her eyes.

And Death took her up like a baby,
And she lay in his icy arms,
But she didn’t feel no chill.
And death began to ride again—
Up beyond the evening star,
Into the glittering light of glory,
On to the Great White Throne.
And there he laid Sister Caroline
On the loving breast of Jesus.

And Jesus took his own hand and wiped away her tears,
And he smoothed the furrows from her face,
And the angels sang a little song,
And Jesus rocked her in his arms,
And kept a-saying: Take your rest,
Take your rest.

Weep not—weep not,
She is not dead;
She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.",James Weldon Johnson,blues poem,Blues Poem,"This poem is a blues poem because it incorporates themes of sorrow, loss, and spiritual comfort, consistent with the blues tradition. It features repeated refrains, such as ""Weep not, weep not,"" which are characteristic of blues lyrics, and it captures the emotional depth associated with the pain of losing a loved one while also conveying a sense of hope and consolation in the face of death.

I’m a Fool to Love You,"Some folks will tell you the blues is a woman,
Some type of supernatural creature.
My mother would tell you, if she could,
About her life with my father,
A strange and sometimes cruel gentleman.
She would tell you about the choices
A young black woman faces.
Is falling in with some man
A deal with the devil
In blue terms, the tongue we use
When we don’t want nuance
To get in the way,
When we need to talk straight?
My mother chooses my father
After choosing a man
Who was, as we sing it,
Of no account.
This man made my father look good,
That’s how bad it was.
He made my father seem like an island
In the middle of a stormy sea,
He made my father look like a rock.
And is the blues the moment you realize
You exist in a stacked deck,
You look in a mirror at your young face,
The face my sister carries,
And you know it’s the only leverage
You’ve got?
Does this create a hurt that whispers
How you going to do?
Is the blues the moment
You shrug your shoulders 
And agree, a girl without money
Is nothing, dust 
To be pushed around by any old breeze? 
Compared to this,
My father seems, briefly,
To be a fire escape.
This is the way the blues works
Its sorry wonders,
Makes trouble look like
A feather bed,
Makes the wrong man’s kisses
A healing.
