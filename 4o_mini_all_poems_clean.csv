In laughter's echo, innocence would skate. 

Holding hands beneath a sprawling oak's shade, 
Dreams whispered gently, before they could fade. 
Dreams whispered gently, before they could fade, 
In that moment, the world asked us to trade. 

Trade carefree moments for the weight of years, 
Watching dusk stretch, wrapped in dreams and fears. 
Watching dusk stretch, wrapped in dreams and fears, 
We learned that joy sometimes hides in the tears. 

That rusted gate still creaks with tales of time, 
Where laughter lingered, but felt more like crime. 
Where laughter lingered, but felt more like crime, 
The sun slipped low behind the rusted gate."
